  <h4 id='3-hump-lacoodaa-id3-hump-lacoodaa'>3-HUMP LACOODA<a id="3-HUMP LACOODA"></a></h4>
  <p>Individual Card FAQs:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>&quot;3-Hump Lacooda&quot;&#39;s effect is an Ignition Effect.</li>
    <li>You don&#39;t have to activate &quot;3-Hump Lacooda&quot;&#39;s effect just because you have 3 copies in play.</li>
    <li>You can choose which of the &quot;3-Hump Lacoodas&quot;&#39; effects you are activating; it can be one of the ones you are Tributing or the one that is remaining on the field.</li>
    <li>Tributing 2 &quot;3-Hump Lacoodas&quot; is a cost.</li>
    <li>If your opponent chains &quot;Ring of Destruction&quot; or &quot;Book of Moon&quot; to the activation of &quot;3-Hump Lacooda&quot;&#39;s effect, the effect is not negated.</li>
    <li>If you Summon your third &quot;3-Hump Lacooda&quot;, you can activate its effect before your opponent activates &quot;Torrential Tribute&quot;.</li>
  </ul>

  <h4 id='4-starred-ladybug-of-dooma-id4-starred-ladybug-of-dooma'>4-STARRED LADYBUG OF DOOM<a id="4-STARRED LADYBUG OF DOOM"></a></h4>
  <p>Netrep Rulings:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>4-Starred Ladybug of Doom destroys monsters that are Level 4 at the time “4-Starred Ladybug of Doom” resolves.</li>
  </ul>
  <br>

  <h4 id='7a-id7a'>7<a id="7"></a></h4>
  <p>Individual Card FAQs:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>If you have 3 &quot;7&quot;&#39;s and destroy them all, you get 2100 Life Points.</li>
    <li>If your opponent also has &quot;7&quot;&#39;s, they are also destroyed.</li>
    <li>If you have 3 &quot;7&quot;&#39;s and activate their effect, your opponent can chain &quot;Imperial Order&quot; to negate the effect.</li>
    <li>Each effect of &quot;7&quot; that gives you 700 Life Points goes on a chain, so if multiple &quot;7&quot;&#39;s are sent to the Graveyard simultaneously, each effect is 1 step in the chain.</li>
    <li>If other cards are also sent to the Graveyard at the same time, like &quot;Sangan&quot; or &quot;Black Pendant&quot;, the card controlled by the turn player is Step 1.</li>
    <li>If your 3rd &quot;7&quot; is activated, but destroyed by &quot;Mystical Space Typhoon&quot; in a chain, you can&#39;t activate its effect, but you still gain 700 Life Points for its Graveyard effect.</li>
  </ul>
  <br>

  <h4 id='7-completeda-id7-completeda'>7 COMPLETED<a id="7 COMPLETED"></a></h4>
  <p>Netrep Rulings:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>The choice of increasing ATK or DEF on the equipped monster is determined when “7 Completed” is activated.</li>
    <li>If “7 Completed” is equipped to another legal target by “Fairy’s Hand Mirror,” the choice of increasing ATK or DEF by the effect of “7 completed” does not change.</li>
    <li>If “7 Completed” is equipped to another legal target by “Tailor of the Fickle,” the choice of increasing ATK or DEF by the effect of “7 Completed” does not change.</li>
  </ul>
  <br>

  <h4 id='8-claws-scorpiona-id8-claws-scorpiona'>8-CLAWS SCORPION<a id="8-CLAWS SCORPION"></a></h4>
  <p>Individual Card FAQs:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Even if &quot;8-Claws Scorpion&quot; is equipped with an Equip Spell Card, its ATK is 2400 when it attacks a face-down Defense Position monster.</li>
    <li>The effect of &quot;8-Claws Scorpion&quot; is a Trigger Effect that is applied if the condition is correct on activation (&quot;8-Claws Scorpion&quot; declared an attack against a face-down Defense Position monster.) The target monster does not have to be in face-down Defense Position when the effect of &quot;8-Claws Scorpion&quot; is resolved. So if &quot;Final Attack Orders&quot; is active, or &quot;Ceasefire&quot; flips the monster face-up, &quot;8-Claws Scorpion&quot; still gets its 2400 ATK.</li>
    <li>The ATK of &quot;8-Claws Scorpion&quot; becomes 2400 during damage calculation. You cannot chain &quot;Rush Recklessly&quot; or &quot;Blast with Chain&quot; to this effect. If these cards were activated before damage calculation, then the ATK of &quot;8-Claws Scorpion&quot; becomes 2400 during damage calculation so those cards have no effect on its ATK.</li>
  </ul>
  <br>

  <h4 id='a-cat-of-ill-omena-ida-cat-of-ill-omena'>A CAT OF ILL OMEN<a id="A CAT OF ILL OMEN"></a></h4>
  <p>Individual Card FAQs:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Show the card to your opponent.</li>
    <li>If &quot;Imperial Order&quot; &amp; &quot;Necrovalley&quot; are both active, and &quot;A Cat of Ill Omen&quot; is flipped, you add the card to your hand because &quot;Necrovalley&quot; is face-up on the field, even though its effect is negated.</li>
    <li>If &quot;Mystical Space Typhoon&quot; is chained to the effect to destroy &quot;Necrovalley&quot;, so that &quot;Necrovalley&quot; is not on the field when this effect resolves, you cannot place the card in your hand.</li>
    <li>You select the card for this effect when the effect resolves, not when it activates.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>Netrep Q&amp;As:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Q: If “Pharaoh’s Treasure” has been successfully placed in the Deck face-up, can the effect of “A Cat of Ill Omen” be used to place it on top of the Deck?<br>
    A: Yes you can. The “Pharaoh’s Treasure” would be placed on top of your Deck. Its effect will activate when it is drawn. But if there is a “Necrovalley” face-up on the field, the “Pharaoh’s Treasure” would be added to your hand right away and would NOT activate its effect (because it isn’t drawn). Curtis Schultz, 04/07/2004</li>
  </ul>

  <h4 id='a-deal-with-dark-rulera-ida-deal-with-dark-rulera'>A DEAL WITH DARK RULER<a id="A DEAL WITH DARK RULER"></a></h4>
  <p>Individual Card FAQs:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>The &quot;Level&quot; in &quot;A Deal with Dark Ruler&quot; is the original Level printed on the Monster Card.</li>
    <li>If your opponent&#39;s Level 8 or higher monster than you control is sent to the Graveyard, you can activate &quot;A Deal with Dark Ruler&quot;.</li>
    <li>You cannot activate &quot;A Deal with Dark Ruler&quot; during the Damage Step.</li>
    <li>You can only Special Summon 1 monster with &quot;A Deal with Dark Ruler&quot;, but you can activate 2 copies of &quot;A Deal with Dark Ruler&quot; to Special Summon 1 &quot;Berserk Dragon&quot; for each, even if only 1 Level 8 or higher monster was sent to the Graveyard.</li>
    <li>You can activate &quot;A Deal with Dark Ruler&quot; if your Level 8 or higher monster that is an Equip Spell Card is sent from your side of the field to the Graveyard (such as &quot;Koitsu&quot; or &quot;Dark Necrofear&quot; destroyed by &quot;Heavy Storm&quot;).</li>
  </ul>
  </p>Netrep Rulings:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>“A Deal with Dark Ruler” may only be activated after a Level 8 or higher monster is sent to the Graveyard from your field.</li>
    <li>“A Deal with Dark Ruler” may not be activated in a chain with an effect that would send a Level 8 or higher monster to the Graveyard if a Level 8 or higher monster has not been sent to the Graveyard this turn.</li>
    <li>If the summon of a Level 8 or higher monster is negated, “A Deal with Dark Ruler” may not be activated for that monster.</li>
    <li>&quot;A Deal with Dark Ruler” may be activated in the End Phase, or the Battle Phase, but cannot be activated in the Damage Step.</li>
  </ul>
  <br>

  <h4 id='a-feather-of-the-phoenixa-ida-feather-of-the-phoenixa'>A FEATHER OF THE PHOENIX<a id="A FEATHER OF THE PHOENIX"></a></h4>
  <p>Individual Card FAQs:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>You can select the card you discarded for the cost of “A Feather of the Phoenix” to be the card returned to the top of your Deck. If you discarded “Night Assailant” or “Makyura the Destructor”, then their effects will activate.</li>
    <li>You can select a Fusion Monster in the Graveyard for “A Feather of the Phoenix” but it is returned to the Fusion Deck.</li>
    <li>Discarding 1 card is a cost to activate this effect. Your opponent can chain “Disappear” to the activation of this card and remove the discarded card from play so that you cannot return it to the top of the Deck.</li>
    <li>This is an effect that targets.</li>
  </ul>
  <br>

  <h4 id='a-feint-plana-ida-feint-plana'>A FEINT PLAN<a id="A FEINT PLAN"></a></h4>
  <p>Individual Card FAQs:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>If &quot;A Feint Plan&quot; is activated and you control only face-down monsters, your opponent cannot attack any of your monsters and they cannot attack your Life Points directly either.</li>
    <li>If you activate &quot;A Feint Plan&quot; after your opponent declares an attack against one of your face-down monsters, that attack resolves as normal, but they cannot attack other face-down monsters for the remainder of the turn. (This is because &quot;A Feint Plan&quot; prevents declaring an attack against a face-down monster, and the attack has already been declared by the time &quot;A Feint Plan&quot; resolves during the Battle Step.)</li>
  </ul>
  <p>Netrep Rulings:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>If “A Feint Plan” is activated in response to an opponent’s declaration of an Attack on a face-down monster, that attack will resolve normally.</li>
    <li>If all of a player’s monsters are face-down in the turn that “A Feint Plan” is activated, the opponent may not attack directly, unless the attacking monster can inherently attack directly, such as “Inaba White Rabbit,” “Jinzo #7,” a monster equipped with “Shooting Star Bow – Ceal”, or Toons.</li>
  </ul>
  <br>

  <h4 id='a-hero-emergesa-ida-hero-emergesa'>A HERO EMERGES<a id="A HERO EMERGES"></a></h4>
  <p>Individual Card FAQs:</p>
  <ul>
  <li>You can Special Summon a high-level monster, like &quot;Dark Magician&quot;, with &quot;A Hero Emerges&quot;. But if your opponent selects a Special Summon-only monster like &quot;Dark Necrofear&quot;, or a Spirit Monster, it is sent to the Graveyard.</li>
  <li>When &quot;Guardian Elma&quot; is selected for &quot;A Hero Emerges&quot;, and you have &quot;Butterfly Dagger - Elma&quot; on your side of the field, you can Special Summon her, but if you don&#39;t have it, then she is sent to the Graveyard.</li>
  <li>You can activate &quot;A Hero Emerges&quot; even if you have only 1 card in your hand.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>Netrep Rulings:</p>
  <ul>
  <li>This ruling addresses what happens if your opponent chooses the following monster card from your hand by the effect of “A Hero Emerges.&quot;</li>
  <li>Special-Summon-only monster: sent to the Graveyard. (Perfectly Ultimate Great Moth, Exodia Necross, Dark Necrofear, Chaos Emperor Dragon - Envoy of the End, all Ritual Monsters, etc.)</li>
  <li>Spirit Monster: sent to the Graveyard. (Yata-Garasu, Hino-Kagu-Tsuchi, Yamata Dragon, Tsukuyomi, etc.)</li>
  <li>Guardian Monster without appropriate Spell Card on the field: sent to the Graveyard. (Guardian Grarl, Guardian Ceal, Guardian Tryce, etc.)</li>
  <li>The effect of “A Hero Emerges” causes a replay.</li>
  </ul>
  <br>

  <h4 id='a-legendary-oceana-ida-legendary-oceana'>A LEGENDARY OCEAN<a id="A LEGENDARY OCEAN"></a></h4>
  <p>Individual Card FAQs:</p>
  <ul>
  <li>You can have 3 cards total in your Deck between &quot;A Legendary Ocean&quot; and &quot;Umi&quot;, because this card’s name is treated as &quot;Umi&quot;. So you cannot have 3 copies of &quot;Umi&quot; and 3 copies of &quot;A Legendary Ocean&quot; in your Deck.</li>
  <li>The name of &quot;A Legendary Ocean&quot; is treated as &quot;Umi&quot; always and for all purposes. If &quot;Imperial Order&quot; is active, the card name is still treated as &quot;Umi&quot;. If the opponent activates &quot;Cursed Seal of the Forbidden Spell&quot; targeting &quot;Umi&quot;, you cannot activate &quot;Umi&quot; or &quot;A Legendary Ocean&quot; for the rest of the Duel.</li>
  <li>When &quot;A Legendary Ocean&quot; is active, you may activate &quot;Tornado Wall&quot;.</li>
  <li>When &quot;A Legendary Ocean&quot; is active, you may Summon or Set Level 5 WATER Monsters from your hand, since they are treated as being Level 4 monsters. If you Set a Level 5 WATER monster you do not have to show your opponent.</li>
  <li>When &quot;A Legendary Ocean&quot; is active, &quot;The Legendary Fisherman&quot; on the field is unaffected by Spell Cards, so it does not receive the ATK/DEF bonus or have its Level reduced by 1. It still is treated as Level 4 in your hand, so you may Summon it without Tribute.</li>
  <li>When the effect of &quot;Cyber Jar&quot; is activated and &quot;A Legendary Ocean&quot; is on the field, you cannot Special Summon Level 5 WATER monsters picked-up by the effect of &quot;Cyber Jar&quot;. This is because the effect of &quot;A Legendary Ocean&quot; does not include Monster Cards in the Deck.</li>
  <li>If &quot;A Legendary Ocean&quot; and &quot;Gravity Bind&quot; are active, you may attack with Level 4 WATER monsters (being treated as Level 3). If &quot;A Legendary Ocean&quot; is destroyed after an attack is declared, a replay occurs because the Level 4 WATER monster can no longer attack.</li>
  <li>If &quot;A Legendary Ocean&quot; and &quot;Infinite Dismissal&quot; are active, and you Summon a Level 4 WATER monster (being treated as Level 3), it will be destroyed during the End Phase.</li>
  <li>&quot;A Legendary Ocean&quot; does not have the effect of &quot;Umi&quot; that increases/decreases the ATK and DEF of specific monster Types.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>Netrep Rulings:</p>
  <ul>
  <li>While “A Legendary Ocean” is on the field, Ritual Summons using WATER monsters as Tributes must take into account the reduced Star Level.</li>
  <li>Cards revealed by “Cyber Jar” or “Morphing Jar #2” are not considered in the hand. The one star reduction given by “A Legendary Ocean” does not apply to monsters revealed by “Cyber Jar” or “Morphing Jar #2’s” effect.</li>
  <li>If “Prohibition” has been activated and “Umi” has been declared, “A Legendary Ocean” may not be played.</li>
  <li>“A Legendary Ocean” is not a valid choice for the effect of “Prohibition.”</li>
  <li>While “The Legendary Fisherman” is face-up on the field and active while “A Legendary Ocean” is face up on the field, “The Legendary Fisherman” will be a 5 Star Monster as it is unaffected by Spell Cards, including “A Legendary Ocean.”</li>
  </ul>

  <h4 id='a-man-with-wdjata-ida-man-with-wdjata'>A MAN WITH WDJAT<a id="A MAN WITH WDJAT"></a></h4>
  <p>Individual Card FAQs:</p>
  <ul>
  <li>If you Set &quot;A Man with Wdjat&quot;, its effect is not activated.</li>
  <li>Any effects of the card you look at are not activated when you look at them with &quot;A Man with Wdjat&quot; (such as a Flip Effect, or if it is a Trap Card, etc.).</li>
  <li>Netrep Rulings:</li>
  <li>If “A Man with Wdjat” is not Normal Summoned, none of its effect will apply. This includes the ‘during each of your following Standby Phases’ text.</li>
  </ul>

  <h4 id='a-rival-appearsa-ida-rival-appearsa'>A RIVAL APPEARS!<a id="A RIVAL APPEARS!"></a></h4>
  <p>Individual Card FAQs:</p>
  <ul>
  <li>For the effect of “A Rival Appears!”, refer to the levels of the monster on the field and the monster in the hand at the time “A Rival Appears!” resolves (for purposes of “Cost Down”, “Level Conversion Lab”, “Mystical Space Typhoon” in a chain destroying “Demotion”, etc.)</li>
  <li>If the opponent’s monster is face-down or not on the field when “A Rival Appears!” resolves, then its effect disappears.</li>
  <li>If you do not have a monster of the same level as the target, you cannot activate “A Rival Appears!”</li>
  </ul>
  <br>

  <h4 id='a-wingbeat-of-giant-dragona-ida-wingbeat-of-giant-dragona'>A WINGBEAT OF GIANT DRAGON<a id="A WINGBEAT OF GIANT DRAGON"></a></h4>
  <p>Netrep Rulings:</p>
  <ul>
  <li>Monsters that are changed to Dragon-Type by an effect are eligible to be targeted by “A Wingbeat of Giant Dragon.”</li>
  <li>Fusion monsters returned to the hand by the effect of “A Wingbeat of Giant Dragon” are returned to the Fusion Deck.</li>
  <li>If the only eligible Dragon-Type monster is removed from the field before “A Wingbeat of Giant Dragon” resolves, the effect of “A Wingbeat of Giant Dragon” disappears.</li>
  <li>“A Wingbeat of Giant Dragon” targets the monster it returns to the hand. The ‘return one Level 5 or higher Dragon-Type’ is not a cost of activation.</li>
  <li>“A Wingbeat of a Giant Dragon” may not be activated while “Lord of D.” is active on the field.</li>
  </ul>
  <br>

  <h4 id='abare-ushionia-idabare-ushionia'>ABARE USHIONI<a id="ABARE USHIONI"></a></h4>
  <p>Individual Card FAQs:</p>
  <ul>
  <li>If you call the coin toss wrong for “Abare Ushioni” you can still prevent the damage with “Pikeru’s Circle of Enchantment”, etc.</li>
  <li>You cannot chain “Barrel Behind the Door” to the effect of “Abare Ushioni” because you don’t know yet if you will take damage or not from the effect.</li>
  </ul>
  <br>

  <h4 id='absolute-enda-idabsolute-enda'>ABSOLUTE END<a id="ABSOLUTE END"></a></h4>
  <p>Individual Card FAQs:</p>
  <ul>
  <li>When &quot;Absolute End&quot; is activated during an attack, that attack becomes a direct attack.</li>
  <li>If &quot;Taunt&quot; and &quot;Absolute End&quot; are both active, the attack becomes a direct attack to your Life Points. This is because the attack target is the monster selected by &quot;Taunt&quot;, but then &quot;Absolute End&quot; turns it into a direct attack.</li>
  </ul>

  <h4 id='abyssal-designatora-idabyssal-designatora'>ABYSSAL DESIGNATOR<a id="ABYSSAL DESIGNATOR"></a></h4>
  <p>Individual Card FAQs:</p>
  <ul>
  <li>If your opponent sends a monster to the Graveyard with the declared Type and Attribute, you cannot see their hand and Deck. But if they claim to have no such card, you can check their hand and Deck to confirm.</li>
  </ul>
  <br>

  <h4 id='acid-trap-holea-idacid-trap-holea'>ACID TRAP HOLE<a id="ACID TRAP HOLE"></a></h4>
  <p>Individual Card FAQs:</p>
  <ul>
  <li>A face-down &quot;Jinzo&quot; will be destroyed by this card.</li>
  <li>If the monster flipped face-up has an effect that changes its DEF, such as &quot;Enraged Muka Muka&quot;, calculate the current DEF, then determine if it will be destroyed or flipped back face-down. So if you had 4 cards in your hand, &quot;Enraged Muka Muka&quot; would not be destroyed.</li>
  <li>If the targeted monster has a Flip Effect, that Effect is activated whether the DEF is greater than 2000 or not. If the DEF of the selected monster is 2000 or less, such as a &quot;Hane-Hane&quot;, it can not select itself for its Flip Effect since it is destroyed.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>Netrep Q&amp;As:</p>
  <ul>
  <li>Q: If “Acid Trap Hole” is activated in a Chain, at what point does its target Flip Effect resolve? Is it immediately DURING the Chain or immediately AFTER the Chain?<br>
  A: After the chain. bishop, 01/28/2004</li>
  <li>Q: What happens if I activate “Acid Trap Hole” in the Battle Step of a Battle Phase? Would I resolve the Flip Effect in the damage step? Could I Chain to the Flip Effect in this case?<br>
  A: The Flip Effect would start a new Chain in the Battle Step. You can respond to it with appropriate card effects. Curtis Schultz, 04/22/2004</li>

  <h4 id='adhesion-trap-holea-idadhesion-trap-holea'>ADHESION TRAP HOLE<a id="ADHESION TRAP HOLE"></a></h4>
  <p>Individual Card FAQs:</p>
  <ul>
  <li>&quot;Adhesion Trap Hole&quot; works against &quot;a monster or monsters&quot;, so &quot;Adhesion Trap Hole&quot; does NOT target.</li>
  <li>When &quot;Cyber Jar&quot; is activated, you may use &quot;Adhesion Trap Hole&quot; against all monsters your opponent Special Summons in face-up Attack Position, but &quot;Adhesion Trap Hole&quot; has no effect on any monsters your opponent Special Summons face-down.</li>
  <li>&quot;Adhesion Trap Hole&quot; cannot affect monsters Special Summoned face-down with &quot;The Shallow Grave&quot;, &quot;Morphing Jar #2&quot;, etc.</li>
  <li>If a monster affected by &quot;Adhesion Trap Hole&quot; is flipped face-down (with &quot;Book of Moon&quot;, etc.), &quot;Adhesion Trap Hole&quot;&#39;s effect disappears and the monster&#39;s ATK is back to normal.</li>
  <li>&quot;Adhesion Trap Hole&quot; halves the original ATK, so if you activate another effect that alters ATK, halve the original ATK first and then resolve the other ATK-modifying effect.</li>
  <li>If a monster affected by &quot;Adhesion Trap Hole&quot; is then equipped with &quot;Megamorph&quot;, only &quot;Megamorph&quot;&#39;s effect applies.</li>

  <p>Individual Card FAQs:</p>
  <ul>
  <li>This card&#39;s title has been changed to &quot;After the Struggle&quot;. If you have a card titled &quot;After Genocide&quot; its name is treated as &quot;After the Struggle&quot;.</li>
  <li>Even if the Battle Damage is reduced to 0 by the effect of &quot;Waboku&quot;, &quot;Kuriboh&quot;, &quot;Sanga of the Thunder&quot;, etc., both the attacking and defending monster are still destroyed during the End Step by this card’s effect.</li>
  <li>If you activate &quot;After the Struggle&quot;, even a monster that performs a direct attack will be destroyed by this card’s effect during the End Step.</li>
  <li>Note that &quot;After the Struggle&quot; will destroy monsters during the End Step, not the End Phase.</li>

  <p>Individual Card FAQs:</p>

  <p>Individual Card FAQs:</p>

  <li>&quot;These monsters&quot; means all of your opponent&#39;s face-up monsters on the field at the time &quot;Amazoness Archers&quot; resolves, not just the monsters that were flipped by &quot;Amazoness Archers&quot;&#39; effect.</li>
  <li>If you activate &quot;Amazoness Archers&quot; during the Battle Phase and your opponent Special Summons another monster afterwards (such as with &quot;Call of the Haunted&quot;, or if &quot;Cyber Jar&quot; is flipped), the newly-Summoned monster is not affected by &quot;Amazoness Archers&quot; and does not suffer the -500 ATK reduction nor does it have to attack.</li>
  <li>The -500 ATK applies to each monster as long as that monster remains face-up on the field. You can activate multiple &quot;Amazoness Archers&quot; and the ATK reductions are cumulative (so -1000 ATK with 2 copies).</li>
  <li>&quot;Amazoness Archers&quot; vs. &quot;Cat&#39;s Ear Tribe&quot;: the ATK is 200.</li>
  <li>If &quot;Fushioh Richie&quot; or &quot;Otohime&quot; are flipped face-up by &quot;Amazoness Archers&#39; effect, their effects are activated because their effects are not Flip Effects; their effects begin a new chain that resolves after the current chain.</li>
  <li>If a face-down &quot;Jinzo&quot; is flipped by &quot;Amazoness Archers&quot;, &quot;Amazoness Archers&quot;&#39; effect is not negated.</li>
  <li>The effect of &quot;Amazoness Archers&quot; will make your opponent have to attack with all of his monsters if he has multiple monsters on his side of the field. If &quot;Amazoness Archers&quot; is in effect, and later a replay occurs, your opponent cannot choose not to attack.</li>
  <li>Monsters that have already attacked cannot attack again. If &quot;The Dark Door&quot; is active, your opponent still can only attack with 1 monster. Monsters which cannot attack still cannot attack (Toon Monsters the turn they are Summoned, &quot;Ultimate Obedient Fiend&quot; under the wrong conditions, etc.) If &quot;Diffusion Wave-Motion&quot; is in effect, only the monster affected by &quot;Diffusion Wave-Motion&quot; can attack. The ATK reduction of &quot;Amazoness Archers&quot; is still applied in these cases where monsters cannot attack.</li>
  <li>If you activate &quot;Amazoness Archers&quot; and chain &quot;Magic Cylinder&quot;, &quot;Magic Cylinder&quot; does the full damage before the -500 ATK is applied; your opponent&#39;s other monsters must attack normally. If you chain &quot;Amazoness Archers&quot; to &quot;Magic Cylinder&quot;, the ATK is reduced first and then &quot;Magic Cylinder&quot; does damage.</li>
  <li>If either player chains &quot;Negate Attack&quot; to &quot;Amazoness Archers&quot;, the Battle Phase ends because of &quot;Negate Attack&quot;&#39;s effect.</li>

  <li>Monsters prevented from attacking may still not attack if under the effect of “Amazoness Archers.”</li>
  <li>Monsters with effects that activate when flipped face-up that are not Flip Effects activate when flipped face up by “Amazoness Archers.”</li>
  <li>The activation of “Amazoness Archers” does not trigger a Replay. The 500 ATK point reduction is permanent for as long as the affected monster remains face-up on the field. Monsters that are ineligible to attack may still not attack.</li>
  <li>If a Replay occurs after “Amazoness Archers” has been activated, the affected player must still attack with all appropriate monsters.</li>
  <li>If “Thousand Eyes Restrict” is face-up on the field when “Amazoness Archers” is activated, only the “Thousand Eyes Restrict” may attack, provided it is the opponent’s monster. If “Thousand Eyes Restrict” is destroyed in that attack, then the other appropriate opponent’s monsters must attack.</li>

  <p>Individual Card FAQs:</p>
  <ul>
  <li>If you Special Summon &quot;Apprentice Magician&quot; face-down (such as with &quot;Apprentice Magician&quot;&#39;s effect) then you do not place a Spell Counter.</li>
  <li>You get to Special Summon a new monster when &quot;Apprentice Magician&quot; is destroyed as a result of battle, even if &quot;Banisher of the Light&quot; is in play.</li>
  <li>Because &quot;Apprentice Magician&quot;&#39;s effect is not a Graveyard effect, the controller of &quot;Apprentice Magician&quot; at the time it is destroyed as a result of battle gets its effect. So if I take control of my opponent&#39;s &quot;Apprentice Magician&quot;, and it is destroyed as a result of battle, then I Special Summon, not the original owner.</li>
  <li>You must show your opponent the monster you Special Summon.</li>
  <li>For effects that place a Spell Counter, you can chain to the activation of those effects. The Spell Counter is actually placed when the effect resolves.</li>
  </ul>

  <li>If your &quot;Apprentice Magician&quot; is destroyed by battle while you control four other monsters, its effect will disappear because you do not have an available Monster Zone space. Curtis Schultz, 04/20/2005</li>

  <li>An active &quot;Skill Drain&quot; can negate the effects of the &quot;D.D. Warrior Lady,&quot; &quot;D.D. Assailant,&quot; and &quot;Apprentice Magician.&quot; But &quot;The End of Anubis&quot; has no effect on them, because they are on the field when their effects activate AND they do not target any card(s) in the Graveyard.

  <li>This card targets your opponent’s monster that is battling your Fiend-Type monster.</li>
  <li>Paying Life Points for this card is a cost.</li>
  <li>You cannot pay more Life Points than necessary. This means that if the target monster has ATK 1500 / DEF 1800, the highest amount of Life Points you can pay is 1800. The target monster will then be an ATK 0 / DEF 0. If the target monster has ATK 1850 / DEF 500, the most you can pay is 1800. This is because you have to play in multiples of 100, and paying 1900 would be paying more than necessary. So you may pay 1800 Life Points and the target monster would become an ATK 50 / DEF 0.</li>

  <li>&quot;Barrel Behind the Door&quot; can only be activated against DAMAGE. It cannot be activated against costs like &quot;Imperial Order&quot; or &quot;Wall of Revealing Light&quot;. It cannot be activated against effects that cause you to lose Life Points like &quot;The Immortal of Thunder&quot;. It cannot be activated against effects that switch damage, like another &quot;Barrel Behind the Door&quot;, because they do not inflict damage, they simply transfer it.</li>
  <li>You cannot activate &quot;Barrel Behind the Door&quot; against a Continuous Spell or Trap Card, an Equip Spell Card, or a Field Spell Card. So you cannot activate it against &quot;Magical Thorn&quot;, &quot;Dark Snake Syndrome&quot;, &quot;Wave-Motion Cannon&quot;, or &quot;Black Pendant&quot;.</li>
  <li>You cannot activate &quot;Barrel Behind the Door&quot; against a Continuous Effect Monster like &quot;Gravekeeper’s Vassal&quot; or &quot;Fire Princess&quot; (even if an effect like &quot;Gift of the Mystical Elf&quot; is activated while &quot;Fire Princess&quot; is on the field).</li>
  <li>You can activate &quot;Barrel Behind the Door&quot; against Normal and Quick-Play Spell and Trap Cards, such as &quot;Tremendous Fire&quot; or &quot;Attack and Receive&quot;.</li>
  <li>You can activate &quot;Barrel Behind the Door&quot; against Trigger Effects like &quot;Lava Golem&quot;, &quot;Giant Germ&quot;, &quot;Relinquished&quot; (when it inflicts effect damage, since &quot;Barrel Behind the Door&quot; can be activated during the Damage Step because it is a Counter-Trap Card), &quot;Minar&quot; (when discarded), &quot;Parasite Paracide&quot; (when it inflicts effect damage), &quot;Bowganian&quot;, &quot;Mushroom Man #2&quot;, &quot;Reflect Bounder&quot; (when it is attacked), &quot;Shinato, King of a Higher Plane&quot; (when it attacks and destroys a Defense Position monster and sends it to the Graveyard), &quot;Granadora&quot; (when destroyed and sent to the Graveyard), &quot;Balloon Lizard&quot; (when destroyed), &quot;KA-2 Des Scissors&quot;, &quot;Needle Burrower&quot;, &quot;Atomic Firefly&quot;, &quot;Elephant Statue of Disaster&quot;, and &quot;Ameba&quot;.</li>

  <li>&quot;Barrel Behind the Door&quot; cannot be activated against cards that do not inflict damage when the card resolves, such as &quot;Graverobber&quot;, which inflicts damage later.</li>
  <li>You can activate &quot;Barrel Behind the Door&quot; against &quot;Ring of Destruction&quot;, and then your opponent will take all of the damage (the damage inflicted to him and the damage that would have been inflicted to you). The same is true for &quot;Tremendous Fire&quot;.</li>
  <li>You can activate &quot;Barrel Behind the Door&quot; against &quot;Magic Cylinder&quot;. The attack will be negated and the damage transferred to the opponent.</li>
  <li>You cannot activate &quot;Barrel Behind the Door&quot; against effects if you don’t know for certain that they will inflict damage when the effect is activated. So you cannot activate it against &quot;Dice Jar&quot;, &quot;Judgment of Anubis&quot;, &quot;Time Wizard&quot; or &quot;Ante&quot;. Your cannot activate &quot;Barrel Behind the Door&quot; against &quot;Ceasefire&quot; if all monsters on the field are face-down, or if all monsters on the field are face-up Normal Monsters, but you can activate it against &quot;Ceasefire&quot; if there is at least 1 face-up Effect Monster on the field.</li>
  <li>You can activate &quot;Barrel Behind the Door&quot; during the Damage Step against appropriate effects, such as &quot;Princess of Tsurugi&quot;, because it is a Counter-Trap.</li>
  <li>Remember that the effects that Counter-Traps are chained to must immediately precede them in the chain. So if you activate &quot;Ring of Destruction&quot;, and intend to chain &quot;Barrel Behind the Door&quot; to it, if your opponent chains something in-between (even an unrelated effect like &quot;Jar of Greed&quot;), then you cannot chain &quot;Barrel Behind the Door&quot; because &quot;Ring of Destruction&quot; is no longer the preceding step in the chain.</li>
  <li>If one player’s &quot;Giant Germ&quot; attacks another &quot;Giant Germ&quot; so that both effects activating during the Damage Step, they form a chain. If both players control &quot;Barrel Behind the Door, only 1 player can chain theirs. The turn player will be able to chain &quot;Barrel Behind the Door&quot; to the opponent’s &quot;Giant Germ&quot; because it is Step 2 of the chain.</li>
  <li>If &quot;Bad Reaction to Simochi&quot; is active, you can activate &quot;Barrel Behind the Door&quot; against effects that would normally cause a Life Point increase, because they inflict damage instead.</li>
  <li>If you re-direct damage to your opponent using &quot;Barrel Behind the Door&quot;, and you have &quot;Dark Room of Nightmare&quot; on the field, then &quot;Dark Room of Nightmare&quot; inflicts 300 more damage.</li>
  <li>For effects like &quot;Princess of Tsurugi&quot; &quot;Thunder Crash&quot;, and &quot;Restructer Revolution&quot;, where damage is added up, &quot;Barrel Behind the Door&quot; re-directs the entire sum of damage.</li>

  <li>It is possible to &quot;properly&quot; Tribute Summon &quot;Behemoth the King of All Animals&quot; with just 1 Tribute. For example, you can Tribute Summon it with &quot;Trojan Horse&quot;, or use &quot;Cost Down&quot; and then Tribute 1 monster because &quot;Behemoth the King of All Animals&quot; is only Level 5. In cases such as this, either 2000 ATK or 2700 ATK is correct, so the controller can select which ATK it will have.</li>
  <li>If &quot;Trojan Horse&quot; is Tributed to Tribute Summon &quot;Behemoth the King of All Animals&quot;, you still only return 1 monster from the Graveyard to your hand, because it’s the same number as the number of monsters you Tributed to perform the Summon.</li>

  <li>If you Tribute Set &quot;Behemoth the King of All Animals&quot; with 1 Tribute, its ATK will only be 2000 points when flipped face-up. However, once it is face-up, if it is flipped face-down again, the effect is reset and its ATK becomes 2700 points.</li>

  <p>Individual Card FAQs:</p>
  <ul>
  <li>&quot;Berserk Dragon&quot; cannot be Normal Summoned or Set, and cannot be Special Summoned EXCEPT by the effect of &quot;A Deal with Dark Ruler&quot;. So &quot;Berserk Dragon&quot; cannot be Special Summoned with &quot;Monster Reborn&quot;, etc., even if Special Summoned properly first.</li>
  <li>If &quot;Berserk Dragon&quot; is removed from play with &quot;Interdimensional Matter Transporter&quot;, you cannot try to resolve &quot;Berserk Dragon&quot;&#39;s effect before it returns to play; you must return it to play first and then it loses 500 ATK.</li>
  <li>While &quot;Skill Drain&quot; is active, &quot;Berserk Dragon&quot;&#39;s effects are negated. But &quot;Berserk Dragon&quot;&#39;s effect doesn&#39;t count turns, so if &quot;Skill Drain&quot; was active for 4 turns, and is then destroyed, do not reduce &quot;Berserk Dragon&quot;&#39;s ATK for those 4 turns.</li>

  <li>If &quot;Final Attack Orders&quot; and &quot;Berserk Gorilla&quot; are both on the field, and the opponent targets &quot;Berserk Gorilla&quot; with &quot;Ring of Destruction&quot;, and you chain &quot;Zero Gravity&quot;, &quot;Berserk Gorilla&quot; is destroyed in the middle of the chain due to &quot;Zero Gravity&quot;&#39;s effect, and &quot;Ring of Destruction&quot;&#39;s effect disappears.</li>
  <li>If you control &quot;Berserk Gorilla&quot; and another monster, &quot;Berserk Gorilla&quot; doesn&#39;t have to be the first monster you attack with, you can attack with other monsters first, as long as you do attack with &quot;Berserk Gorilla&quot;.</li>

  <h4 id='big-bang-shota-idbig-bang-shota'>BIG BANG SHOT<a id="BIG BANG SHOT"></a></h4>
  <p>Individual Card FAQs:</p>
  <ul>
  <li>When the monster equipped with &quot;Big Bang Shot&quot; is destroyed, and &quot;Big Bang Shot&quot; is destroyed as a result of this, the equipped monster is not removed from play.</li>
  <li>The effect of &quot;Big Bang Shot&quot; that removes the equipped monster from play can be resolved between steps of a chain. For example, if &quot;Change of Heart&quot; targets a monster equipped with &quot;Big Bang Shot&quot;, and &quot;Mystical Space Typhoon&quot; is chained to &quot;Change of Heart&quot; to destroy &quot;Big Bang Shot&quot;, first resolve &quot;Mystical Space Typhoon&quot; and destroy &quot;Big Bang Shot&quot;, then remove the monster that was equipped from play, and THEN resolve &quot;Change of Heart&quot; (and the effect of &quot;Change of Heart&quot; disappears).</li>
  <li>If a monster equipped with &quot;Big Bang Shot&quot; is flipped face-down, it is no longer a target of &quot;Big Bang Shot&quot; so &quot;Big Bang Shot&quot; is sent to the Graveyard and the monster is not removed from play.</li>
  <li>When &quot;Imperial Order&quot; is active, and you destroy &quot;Big Bang Shot&quot; with &quot;Dust Tornado&quot;, the effect of &quot;Big Bang Shot&quot; that would remove the monster from play is NOT applied.</li>
  <li>When you send &quot;Big Bang Shot&quot; to the Graveyard with &quot;Emergency Provisions&quot;, the monster is removed from play at the same time.</li>
  <li>When equipped to &quot;Guardian Ceal&quot;, if you send &quot;Big Bang Shot&quot; to the Graveyard as a cost for &quot;Guardian Ceal&quot;&#39;s effect, &quot;Guardian Ceal&quot; is removed from play but &quot;Guardian Ceal&quot;&#39;s effect still resolves.</li>
  <li>If a monster is equipped with &quot;Big Bang Shot&quot; and &quot;Fiber Jar&quot; is activated, both &quot;Big Bang Shot&quot; and the equipped monster are shuffled into the Deck, and the equipped monster is not removed from play even though &quot;Big Bang Shot&quot; was removed from the field.</li>
  <li>If you equip your &quot;Big Bang Shot&quot; to your opponent&#39;s &quot;Dark Magician&quot;, and &quot;Dark Magician&quot; attacks your &quot;Giant Soldier of Stone&quot;, the opponent of the owner of the &quot;Big Bang Shot&quot; takes the damage (so your opponent, who attacked with &quot;Dark Magician&quot;, takes 900 points of damage.)</li>
  <li>The battle damage caused when the equipped monster attacks a Defense Position monster is considered to come from the equipped monster, not from &quot;Big Bang Shot&quot;. So a &quot;Don Zaloog&quot; equipped with &quot;Big Bang Shot&quot; could still make the opponent discard 1 card when attacking a face-down monster with low DEF.</li>
  <li>If you Special Summon a monster with &quot;Premature Burial&quot;, and equip it with &quot;Big Bang Shot&quot;, and &quot;Heavy Storm&quot; is activated, the effects of &quot;Premature Burial&quot; and &quot;Big Bang Shot&quot; form a chain, with the controller of the 2 cards determining the order in which they are placed on the chain, and the order in which they are resolved. If the controller chooses &quot;Big Bang Shot&quot; to be Step 2, then the monster will be removed from play. If the controller chooses &quot;Premature Burial&quot; to be Step 2, then the monster will be destroyed and sent to the Graveyard.</li>

Nor can you use &quot;Big Burn&quot; when monsters are removed for a condition.</li>

  <li>You can chain &quot;Big Burn&quot; to effects like &quot;Disappear&quot;, &quot;The Shallow Grave&quot;, or &quot;Spear Cretin&quot;.</li>
  <li>You can&#39;t activate &quot;Big Burn&quot; when &quot;Sinister Serpent&quot; activates in the Graveyard, because &quot;Sinister Serpent&quot; doesn&#39;t target.</li>

  <p>Individual Card FAQs:</p>

  <li>A face-down &quot;Big Shield Gardna&quot; can only negate a Spell Card that targets 1 face-down monster, so it cannot negate &quot;Riryoku&quot;, &quot;Creature Swap&quot; or &quot;Dark Hole&quot;, but could negate &quot;Nobleman of Crossout&quot; or &quot;Tribute to the Doomed&quot;.</li>
  <li>If &quot;Big Shield Gardna&quot; is targeted with a Spell Card, you may chain &quot;Book of Moon&quot; to flip it face-down, then it can negate the Spell Card and will flip back to face-up Defense Position.</li>
  <li>&quot;Skill Drain&quot; only negates the effects of monsters that are face-up on the field, so a face-down &quot;Big Shield Gardna&quot; may still negate a Spell Card that targets it while &quot;Skill Drain&quot; is active on the field. It will still be flipped to face-up Defense Position, and now its effect that changes its battle position when it is attacked will be negated.</li>
  <li>If &quot;Prickle Fairy&quot; attacks a face-down &quot;Big Shield Gardna&quot; both their effects will occur at the end of the Damage Step. &quot;Prickle Fairy&quot; will be Step 1 and &quot;Big Shield Gardna&quot; Step 2.

  <li>The effect of “Big-Tusked Mammoth” includes those monsters Summoned this turn before “Big-Tusked Mammoth” was face-up on the field.

However, if the monster and the &quot;Butterfly Dagger - Elma&quot; are destroyed simultaneously by a card like &quot;Final Destiny&quot;, then you can return it to your hand.</li>

  <li>You gain control of the targeted monster in the same Battle Position that it was in on your opponent’s side of the field. If it is face-down you may Flip Summon it and any Flip Effect is activated. During your End Phase it is returned to your opponent’s side of the field in the same Battle Position as you last had it in. So if you attacked with the monster and it remained in Attack Position, it will return to your opponent in Attack Position.</li>
  <li>You can use the monster you control through the effect of &quot;Change of Heart&quot; as a Tribute for a Tribute Summon, or for an effect like &quot;Cannon Soldier’s&quot;.</li>

  <p>Netrep Rulings:</p>

  <li>&quot;Change of Heart” is a targeting Spell Card.</li>
  <li>It is not required to Flip the face-down monster taken control of by “Change of Heart” to look at it.</li>
  <li>If the monster affected by “Change of Heart” is turned face-down, that monster will return to the original controller at the End Phase as normal.</li>
  <li>If the monster affected by “Change of Heart” is temporarily removed from play, that monster will return to the original controller when the monster returns to play.</li>
  <li>A face-up “Blindly Loyal Goblin” may not be targeted by “Change of Heart.” If a face-down “Blindly Loyal Goblin” changes control through the effect of “Change of Heart” or similar cards and “Blindly Loyal Goblin” is turned face-up, control of “Blindly Loyal Goblin” will not return to the original controller.</li>
  <li>If a monster that changes control via “Change of Heart” is turned face-down by “Book of Moon,” the monster will return to the original controller’s field when the turn ends as normal per “Change of Heart.”</li>
  <li>If a monster that changes control via “Change of Heart” is temporarily removed from the field via “Dimensionhole” or “Interdimensional Matter Transporter,” that monster will return to the original controller’s control when it returns to the field.</li>

  <p>Netrep Q&amp;As:</p>
  <ul>
  <li>Q: If the opponent activates “Change of Heart” or “Snatch Steal” with only 3 Monster Zone spaces remaining and you chain with “Ojama Trio”, what will happen to the monster the opponent is trying to take control of?<br>
  A: When they take control of the monster, if there are no longer any open Monster Zone spaces for the taken monster it will be destroyed. Curtis Schultz, 01/28/2004</li>
  <li>Q: Can “Change of Heart” or “Snatch Steal” be activated to destroy an opponent’s monster if all 5 Monster Zone spaces are full or does it only happen during the resolution of a chain?<br>
  A: It is during the resolution of a chain. If you do not have any empty zones in your Monster Zone you cannot activate &quot;Change of Heart&quot; or &quot;Snatch Steal&quot; to take control of an opponent&#39;s monster. Curtis Schultz, 01/29/2004</li>
  <li>Q: If I use “Change of Heart” on a face up monster and then my opponent chains “Book of Moon” to flip his monster face-down, does my “Change of Heart” lose its target or do I get the monster that is now in face-down Defense Position?<br>
  A: &quot;Change of Heart&quot; will take control of the monster as normal. &quot;Change of Heart&quot; can be used to take control of a face-up or face-down monster, so using &quot;Book of Moon&quot; doesn&#39;t prevent &quot;Change of Heart&quot; from resolving, or the monster from returning at the end of the turn. Steve Okegawa, 02/11/2004</li>
  <li>Q: Say Player A plays “Snatch Steal” on Player B’s “Jinzo”. Then Player B uses “Change of Heart” on “Jinzo” and then “Book of Moon”. What would happen to “Jinzo”?<br>
  A: During the End Phase “Jinzo” would return to the previous controller. Player A, based on your example. Curtis Schultz, 01/18/2004 </li>

  <li>When &quot;Chaos Command Magician&quot; is targeted by a card that doesn&#39;t select only 1 target, the effect of &quot;Chaos Command Magician&quot; is NOT applied and the effect resolves as normal.</li>
  <li>When &quot;Penguin Soldier&quot; targets 2 monsters, including &quot;Chaos Command Magician&quot;, this is an effect targets, but not one that select &quot;1 target&quot;. So &quot;Chaos Command Magician&quot; will not negate the effect of &quot;Penguin Soldier&quot;. However, if &quot;Penguin Soldier&quot; only targets &quot;Chaos Command Magician&quot;, then it is an effect that selects &quot;1 target&quot; so &quot;Chaos Command Magician&quot; WILL negate the effect of &quot;Penguin Soldier&quot;.</li>
  <li>Vs. &quot;Dark Cat With White Tail&quot;, that effect selects 3 targets so &quot;Chaos Command Magician&quot; will not negate &quot;Dark Cat With White Tail&quot;&#39;s effect.</li>
  <li>If &quot;Chaos Command Magician&quot; is targeted by &quot;Dark Necrofear&quot;, that effect selects 1 target so the effect of &quot;Dark Necrofear&quot; is negated and it is not equipped to &quot;Chaos Command Magician&quot;.</li>
  <li>When &quot;Chaos Command Magician&quot; battles &quot;D. D. Warrior Lady&quot;, her effect is NOT negated because it does not target.</li>
  <li>You can activate the effect of &quot;Metallizing Parasite - Lunatite&quot; and target &quot;Chaos Command Magician&quot;, but &quot;Chaos Command Magician&quot; will negate the effect and &quot;Metallizing Parasite - Lunatite&quot; will remain on the field as a monster.</li>

  <li>&quot;Chaos Emperor Dragon - Envoy of the End&quot; sends itself to the Graveyard as part of its effect, and counts itself for determining how much damage it inflicts.</li>
  <li>The damage that &quot;Chaos Emperor Dragon - Envoy of the End&quot; inflicts is equal to the number of cards BOTH players send to the Graveyard times 300 points.</li>
  <li>&quot;Barrel Behind the Door&quot; and &quot;Trap of Board Eraser&quot; can be chained to &quot;Chaos Emperor Dragon - Envoy of the End&quot;&#39;s effect. &quot;Barrel Behind the Door&quot; is, itself, sent to the Graveyard by &quot;Chaos Emperor Dragon - Envoy of the End&quot;&#39;s effect and counts for an additional 300 points as a result.</li>
  <li>If &quot;Chaos Emperor Dragon - Envoy of the End&quot; is destroyed or removed from play by an effect chained to its own effect, its effect still resolves.</li>
  <li>Tokens will be removed from the field by &quot;Chaos Emperor Dragon - Envoy of the End&quot;&#39;s effect, but will not add to the damage total because they are not sent to the Graveyard.</li>
  <li>It is the controller, not the owner, of &quot;Chaos Emperor Dragon - Envoy of the End&quot; that can activate its effect and that inflicts damage to his/her opponent.</li>
  <li>If you control your opponent&#39;s &quot;Chaos Emperor Dragon - Envoy of the End&quot; and you pay the 1000 Life Points, the effect inflicts damage to your opponent even though the monster returns to your opponent&#39;s Graveyard.</li>
  <li>If &quot;Chaos Emperor Dragon - Envoy of the End&quot; is Special Summoned, and the controller immediately activates its effect, and the opponent chains &quot;Torrential Tribute&quot; as Step 2 of a chain, &quot;Torrential Tribute&quot; destroys all monsters on the field and sends them to the Graveyard, then &quot;Chaos Emperor Dragon - Envoy of the End&quot;&#39;s effect resolves, sends all Spell &amp; Trap Cards on the field to the Graveyard, and inflicts 300 points of damage to the opponent for each Spell &amp; Trap Card sent to the Graveyard by its effect. (Monster Cards do not count toward the damage because they were destroyed and sent to the Graveyard in the middle of the chain by &quot;Torrential Tribute&quot;.)</li>
  <li>If &quot;Waboku&quot; is chained to the effect of &quot;Chaos Emperor Dragon - Envoy of the End&quot;, it will not prevent the damage because &quot;Waboku&quot; only applies to Battle Damage. Also, &quot;Waboku&quot; will still be on the field when &quot;Chaos Emperor Dragon - Envoy of the End&quot;&#39;s effect is applied, so it will still count for 300 points of damage to the opponent.</li>
  <li>When &quot;Minar&quot; and &quot;Electric Snake&quot; are sent to the Graveyard by &quot;Chaos Emperor Dragon - Envoy of the End&quot;, their effects are not activated because the modified text on those cards says when they are &quot;discarded to the Graveyard from the hand&quot;.</li>

  <li>Q: Will the effect of &quot;Gravekeeper’s Watcher&quot; stop the effect of &quot;Chaos Emperor Dragon – Envoy of the End&quot;?<br>
  A: &quot;Discard&quot; and &quot;Send&quot; are not the same. You cannot use &quot;Gravekeeper&#39;s Watcher&quot; against the effect of the Chaos Emperor Dragon. Curtis Schultz, 03/07/2004</li>

  A: &quot;Super Rejuvenation&quot; will not work with the effect of &quot;Chaos Emperor Dragon - Envoy of the End.&quot; &quot;Super Rejuvenation&quot; works for Dragon-Type monsters discarded from your hand or Tributed from your side of the field during the turn. &quot;Chaos Emperor Dragon – Envoy of the End&#39;s&quot; effect does not Tribute any monsters.

  <li>If you control 2 face-up &quot;Command Knights&quot;, and no other monsters, and 1 of them is equipped with &quot;Ring of Magnetism&quot;, your opponent cannot attack because the 2 &quot;Command Knights&quot; are preventing an attack from being declared. &quot;Ring of Magnetism&quot;’s effect forcefully leads the attack to the equipped monster only when the opponent declares an attack, which is impossible for your opponent to do.</li>
  <li>If &quot;Umi&quot; is active and you have &quot;The Legendary Fisherman&quot; on the field, your opponent can attack directly. But if you have &quot;Legendary Fisherman&quot; and &quot;Command Knight&quot;, and no other monsters, your opponent cannot attack directly because of &quot;Command Knight&quot;, and cannot attack &quot;Command Knight&quot; because of his effect, and cannot attack &quot;The Legendary Fisherman&quot;, so he cannot declare an attack (but can enter the Battle Phase to activate card effects).</li>
  <li>If you control &quot;Patrician of Darkness&quot; and &quot;Command Knight&quot;, and your opponent attacks, you cannot choose the &quot;Command Knight&quot; as the attack target.</li>
  <li>If you control &quot;Command Knight&quot; equipped with &quot;Raregold Armor&quot;, your opponent can attack &quot;Command Knight&quot;.</li>
  <li>If you control a &quot;Command Knight&quot; and another monster, and your opponent attacks the other monster, you can use &quot;Shift&quot; to select &quot;Command Knight&quot; as the new attack target.</li>
  <li>You can choose your own &quot;Command Knight&quot; as the attack target when your opponent attacks your &quot;Dreamsprite&quot;.</li>
  <li>&quot;Command Knight&quot;’s effect increases its own ATK by 400 points, in addition to your other Warrior-Type monsters.</li>
  <li>If you control multiple &quot;Command Knights&quot;, their effects are cumulative so each will increase all of your Warrior-Type monsters&#39; ATK by 400 points.</li>
  <li>If &quot;Command Knight&quot; is Normal Summoned, Flip summoned, or Special Summoned, its ATK is at least 1600 so your opponent can activate &quot;Bottomless Trap Hole&quot;.</li>
  <li>If &quot;King Tiger Wanghu&quot; is on the field face-up, and &quot;Command Knight&quot; is Summoned, the effect of &quot;Command Knight&quot; is applied immediately because it is a Continuous Effect, so first change &quot;Command Knight&quot;’s ATK to 1600. After that, &quot;King Tiger Wanghu&quot;’s effect cannot activate because &quot;Command Knight&quot;’s ATK is not 1400 or lower.</li>
  <li>If &quot;Physical Double&quot; creates a Mirage Token of a Warrior-Type monster while &quot;Command Knight&quot; is on the field, take the current ATK (including &quot;Command Knight&quot; Bonus), then apply all bonuses again if appropriate. So a Mirage Token of a 1600 ATK Warrior-Type monster would be ATK 2000 (it copies the 1600 ATK and then gains &quot;Command Knight&quot;’s +400 ATK bonus).</li>

  A: Yes, you can chain &quot;Compusory Evacuation Device&quot; to the flip effect of &quot;Cyber Jar&quot; and &quot;Fiber Jar&quot; when you Flip Summon them. The &quot;Cyber Jar&quot;/&quot;Fiber Jar&quot; would return to your hand first, then its effect would resolve.

  <li>Q: “Contract with the Abyss” states in its text that the Level Stars of the monsters being offered as a Tribute equal that of the Ritual Monster being Ritual Summoned. Can the total of Level Stars being offered be higher than the Ritual Monster or must it be exactly equal?<br>
  A: The total Level Stars of the monster(s) offered as a Tribute for the Ritual Summon using &quot;Contract with the Abyss&quot; must equal the Level Stars of the DARK Ritual Monster you are attempting to Ritual Summon. You cannot go above the Level Stars of the DARK Ritual Monster. So if I want to Ritual Summon &quot;Dark Master - Zorc&quot; using &quot;Contract with Abyss,&quot; I must offer monsters whose total Level Stars = 8. I cannot go above 8. I could offer two 4-Level Star monsters and the total would equal 8. I could offer four 2-Level Star monsters, because they would equal 8. I would not be able to offer a 5-Level Star and a 4-Level Star monster because their total Level Stars would equal 9. Curtis Schultz, 02/23/2004</li>

  <p>Individual Card FAQs:</p>
  <ul>
  <li>The effect of “Cybernetic Magician” is an Ignition Effect that targets a monster.</li>
  <li>Since “Cybernetic Magician” makes the ATK “become” 2000, that is the new value. Even if the monster was equipped with an Equip Spell Card, the ATK is 2000 and is not adjusted, even if the Equip Spell Card is destroyed. (However, if equipped after the effect of “Cybernetic Magician” resolves, the ATK will be adjusted from the new level of 2000 points.)</li>
  <li>If a monster is getting an ATK adjustment because of a Field Spell Card, and you use the effect of “Cybernetic Magician” on it, then its ATK becomes 2000 and is not adjusted by the Field Spell Card until the effect of “Cybernetic Magician” expires. (However, if a new Field Spell Card is activated that changes the ATK, it will adjust it from the new 2000 ATK level.)</li>
  <li>You cannot target a monster with “Cybernetic Magician” if its ATK is already 2000 (like “Vampire Lord”). This includes monsters that have 2000 ATK because of the effect of “Cybernetic Magician”.</li>
  <li>If you target a “Raging Flame Sprite” that currently has 3100 ATK with the effect of “Cybernetic Magician”, at the end of the turn its ATK will return to 3100 points, not 100.</li>

  <li>“Set”, as an adjective (as in the second sentence of “D.D. Trap Hole”), means a face-down monster. So if “Ceasefire” is chained to “D.D. Trap Hole”, the effect of “D.D. Trap Hole” disappears because the opponent’s monster is no longer Set.</li>
  <li>If either targeted monster is removed from play before “D.D. Trap Hole” resolves, then the effect of “D.D. Trap Hole” disappears.</li>
  <li>You cannot activate “D.D. Trap Hole” during the damage step.</li>

  <li>Q: If “Dark Necrofear’s” ATK value is lowered upon summoning and targeted by “Chain Destruction”, will the other copies of “Dark Necrofear”, which were destroyed by “Chain Destruction” activate?<br>
  A: Yes the “Dark Necrofears” would activate their effects during the End Phase, since they were destroyed by an opponent’s card effect. Keep in mind that they would not be able to be Special Summoned from the Graveyard as a monster though, since they were never Special Summoned once before via their effect.

  A: &quot;Dark Necrofear&quot; was an Equip Spell Card at the time it was destroyed by &quot;Mystical Space Typhoon&quot; and sent to the Graveyard. It was not a monster. Because of this, you would not be able to activate &quot;A Deal with Dark Ruler.&quot; Curtis Schultz, 03/04/2004</li>

  <li>If your Fiend-Type monster battles with &quot;Relinquished&quot; equipped with a &quot;Sangan&quot; or a &quot;Witch of the Black Forest&quot; and the equipped card is destroyed instead of &quot;Relinquished&quot;, the effect of &quot;Sangan&quot;, etc., will activate since it was the effect of &quot;Relinquished&quot; that destroyed it. It was not destroyed as a result of battle with the Fiend-Type monster.</li>
  <li>If your &quot;Dark Ruler Ha Des&quot; or other Fiend-Type monster destroys &quot;Tyrant Dragon&quot; as a result of battle, a Dragon-Type monster must still be Tributed when &quot;Tyrant Dragon&quot; is Special Summoned from the Graveyard. This is because Tributing a Dragon-Type monster is a condition on the Summoning of the card; it is not part of the effect. For the same reason, if a Spirit Monster is destroyed by a Fiend-Type monster when &quot;Dark Ruler Ha Des&quot; is on the field, it still cannot be Special Summoned from the Graveyard. Also if two &quot;Dark Ruler Ha Des&quot; destroy each other in battle, neither can be Special Summoned from the Graveyard.</li>
  <li>&quot;Dark Ruler Ha Des&quot; cannot be Special Summoned from the Graveyard even if you try to Special Summon it face-down by the effect of &quot;Spear Cretin&quot; or &quot;The Shallow Grave&quot;.</li>
  <li>You can activate &quot;Return of the Doomed&quot; to return &quot;Dark Ruler Ha Des&quot; to your hand during the turn which it was destroyed, because this does not Special Summon it, it merely returns the card to your hand.</li>
  <li>The effect of &quot;Fiber Jar&quot; will shuffle &quot;Dark Ruler Ha Des&quot; back into your Deck even if &quot;Dark Ruler Ha Des&quot; is in the Graveyard and cannot be Special Summoned.</li>
  <li>&quot;Dark Ruler Ha Des&quot; may be Special Summoned by &quot;Dimension Fusion&quot; or &quot;Return from the Different Dimension&quot; if it was removed from play.</li>

  <li>Netrep Q&amp;As:</li>
  <li>Q: Can “De-Fusion” be used against an opponent’s X-Y-Z Fusion Monster to send it back to the Fusion Deck without Special Summoning the Fusion Material Monsters?</li>
  <li>A: “De-Fusion” can be used on the 4 X, Y, and Z Fusion variations. The result will be the X-Y-Z Fusion monster being returned to the Fusion Deck. No monsters will be Special Summoned from the Graveyard because the X-Y-Z Fusions are not proper Fusion Summons. It will not matter if the X-Y-Z piece exists in the Graveyard. This is similar to using “De-Fusion” on a Fusion Monster Special Summoned through the effect of “Magical Scientist” and/or “Summoner of Illusions.” Curtis Schultz, 01/17/2004</li>

You cannot activate &quot;Desrook Archfiend&quot;&#39;s effect in the middle of a chain, such as if &quot;Pot of Greed&quot; was activated and &quot;Ring of Destruction&quot; was chained to destroy &quot;Terrorking Archfiend&quot; and send him to the Graveyard in the middle of the chain.</li>

  <li>The &quot;proper order&quot; in the text of &quot;Destiny Board&quot; means the order the Spirit Messages are placed on the field, not the order that they occupy your Spell and Trap Card Zones. So if you read your Zones from left to right as N-F-A-I-L, it is okay as long as they came on the field in the order of F-I-N-A-L.</li>
  <li>If you have two copies of &quot;Destiny Board&quot; on the field you may place two Spirit Messages from your hand or Deck onto the field but you cannot place the fifth one until one of your two &quot;Destiny Boards&quot; is removed from the field.</li>

  <li>If your &quot;Destiny Board&quot; or any of your Spirit Messages is destroyed or removed from the field, all your remaining Spirit Messages and &quot;Destiny Boards&quot; on the field are destroyed. If your opponent has any, they are not destroyed.</li>
  <li>If &quot;Imperial Order&quot; is active on the field it will not stop the effect of &quot;Destiny Board&quot; to place Spirit Messages on the field, nor will it stop a player who completes the message from declaring victory.</li>
  <li>If &quot;Jinzo&quot; or &quot;Royal Decree&quot; is on the field, &quot;Destiny Board’s effect will be negated and you cannot place a Spirit Message on the field. Also if one of the Spirit Messages or &quot;Destiny Board&quot; is destroyed while &quot;Jinzo&quot; or &quot;Royal Decree&quot; is on the field, the others will NOT be destroyed. If &quot;Jinzo&quot; is destroyed in the End Phase you may activate &quot;Destiny Board&quot;’s effect afterwards.</li>
  <li>&quot;Cold Wave&quot; will prevent the effect of &quot;Destiny Board&quot; to bring a Spirit Message to the field for the turn &quot;Cold Wave&quot; is activated.</li>
  <li>The placing of a Spirit Message on the field by the effect of &quot;Destiny Board&quot; cannot be negated with &quot;Magic Jammer&quot;, &quot;Magic Drain&quot;, &quot;Solemn Judgment&quot;, etc.</li>

    <li>Q: Can you activate “Dice Re-Roll” in response to your opponent rolling a die?<br>
    A: &quot;Dice Re-roll&quot; does not care why the dice roll was performed, either offensive or defensive. Curtis Schultz, 01/29/2004</li>
    <li>Q: If an Archfiend monster is targeted by “Change of Heart” when is the proper time to activate “Dice Re-Roll”?<br>
    A: You would activate &quot;Dice Re-roll&quot; in response to the &quot;Change of Heart.&quot; You would not wait until the Archfiend die roll. If you wait that long then you will already be resolving the chain, and at that point it would be too late to activate the &quot;Dice Re-roll.&quot; Curtis Schultz, 01/29/2004</li>
    <li>Q: If “Dice Re-Roll’s” effect is used for the flip of “Dice Jar”, can you decide to re-roll your own and leave your opponent’s die roll?<br>
    A: BOTH players would have to re-roll the die. Curtis Schultz, 01/29/2004</li>

  <li>You can activate the effect of “Divine Wrath” to a Flip Effect, Ignition Effect, Trigger Effect, or Multi-Trigger Effect. But not to a Continuous Effect. This is because Continuous Effects cannot be chained to.</li>
  <li>“Divine Wrath” is NOT a card that targets, so “Divine Wrath” may be used against Dragon-Type monsters while “King Dragun” or “Lord of D.” is on the field.</li>
  <li>You can activate the effect of &quot;Divine Wrath&quot; against an effect monster&#39;s effect that happens anywhere: on the field, in the hand, in the Graveyard, or removed from play.</li>
  <li>You must chain &quot;Divine Wrath&quot; to an effect directly preceeding it in the chain. For example, if &quot;Airknight Parshath&quot; equipped with &quot;Cestus of Dagla&quot; attacks a Defense Position monster, &quot;Airknight Parshath&quot; inflicts damage to the opponent&#39;s Life Points during damage calculation. Then, during effect resolution, there are 2 simultaneous Trigger Effects that the controller places in a chain however he likes. If the effect of &quot;Airknight Parshath&quot; is Step 1 and &quot;Cestus of Dagla&quot; is Step 2, the opponent cannot chain &quot;Divine Wrath&quot;. However, if &quot;Cestus of Dagla&quot; is Step 1 and &quot;Airknight Parshath&quot; is Step 2, &quot;Divine Wrath&quot; can be chained. In this case, the effect of &quot;Airknight Parshath&quot; that allows the controller to draw a card is negated, &quot;Airknight Parshath&quot; is destroyed, and the effect of &quot;Cestus of Dagla&quot; disappears before it resolves.</li>
  <li>Another example: if &quot;D.D. Warrior Lady&quot; attacks a face-down &quot;Morphing Jar&quot;, and activates her effect to remove both cards from play, &quot;D.D. Warrior Lady&quot; is Step 2 because she has an optional effect, and &quot;Morphing Jar&quot; is Step 1 because its effect is mandatory. So &quot;Divine Wrath&quot; can be chained to the effect of &quot;D.D. Warrior Lady&quot; to negate its effect, but not to the effect of &quot;Morphing Jar&quot; to negate its effect.</li>
  <li>You can chain “Divine Wrath” to the effect of “The Creator” (Ignition Effect), “Fox Fire” when it is Special Summoned (Trigger Effect), “Strike Ninja” (Multi-Trigger Effect), and “Homunculus the Alchemic Being” (Ignition Effect).</li>
  <li>You can activate “Divine Wrath” in a chain to a Trigger Effect that activates when the Effect Monster is Summoned such as “Breaker the Magical Warrior”, “Dark Magician of Chaos”, or “Marauding Captain”. The opponent must declare the activation of “Marauding Captain”’s effect before “Divine Wrath” can be activated. In this case, the monster that would have been Special Summoned remains in the opponent’s hand.</li>
  <li>You can activate “Divine Wrath” during the Damage Step because it is a Counter-Trap, so you may activate it to negate the effect of “D. D. Warrior Lady”, “Reflect Bounder”, “Injection Fairy Lily”, “D. D. Crazy Beast”, &quot;Dark Paladin&quot;, or “Mystical Knight of Jackal”.</li>
  <li>If you activate &quot;Divine Wrath&quot; during the Damage Step to destroy the attacking monster or the monster being attacked, the monster is destroyed. No replay occurs because a replay can only happen during the Battle Step. If damage calculation has not been performed yet, it is not performed.</li>
  <li>You can activate “Divine Wrath” against “Sasuke Samurai” or “Mystic Swordsman LV2” when they attack a face-down Defense Position monster.</li>
  <li>You can activate “Divine Wrath” to negate either effect of “Don Zaloog” and to negate the effect of “Airknight Parshath” that allows its controller to draw a card.</li>
  <li>You can activate “Divine Wrath” to negate an effect that activates in the Graveyard, such as “Witch of the Black Forest”, “Mystic Tomato”, “Despair from the Dark”, “Night Assailant”, “Electric Snake”, and “Sangan”.</li>
  <li>You can activate “Divine Wrath” when the opponent discards “Kuriboh” from his / her hand to negate the effect of “Kuriboh” and when a “Night Assailant” is discarded to negate the effect of returning a Flip Effect monster to the owner’s hand.</li>
  <li>You can activate “Divine Wrath” when “Exiled Force”, “Red-Eyes B. Chick”, or “Paladin of White Dragon” is Tributed for its own effect.</li>
  <li>You can activate “Divine Wrath” when “Dark Necrofear” activates its effect in the Graveyard during the End Phase, and since a monster in the Graveyard cannot be destroyed, &quot;Dark Necrofear&quot; is not destroyed by a card effect, so its effect does not activate again.</li>
  <li>You can chain “Divine Wrath” to the effect of “King Dragun” that Special summons a Dragon-Type monster.</li>
  <li>You can activate “Divine Wrath” when the opponent uses “Relinquished”’s effect to equip itself with a monster, or when “Relinquished”’s effect inflicts damage.</li>
  <li>You can activate “Divine Wrath” when a Spirit Monster is returned to the owner’s hand by its own effect, and the Spirit Monster will be destroyed and sent to the Graveyard.</li>
  <li>You can activate &quot;Divine Wrath&quot; when the effect of &quot;Helpoemer&quot; activates in the Graveyard, and the effect of &quot;Helpoemer&quot; will not activate again.</li>
  <li>You can activate &quot;Divine Wrath&quot; when &quot;Vampire Lord&quot; or &quot;Sacred Phoenix of Nephthys&quot; activate their effects in the Graveyard, and their effects are negated and they are not Special Summoned; but because they cannot be &quot;destroyed&quot; while in the Graveyard, they are not destroyed by a card effect so their effect will not activate again.</li>
  <li>You can chain &quot;Divine Wrath&quot; to the activation of &quot;Peten the Dark Clown&quot;, and the effect of &quot;Peten the Dark Clown&quot; will not resolve (however, the &quot;Peten the Dark Clown&quot; that was removed from play remains out of play).</li>
  <li>You can activate &quot;Divine Wrath&quot; when the effect of &quot;Black Luster Soldier - Envoy of the Beginning&quot; activates that allows it to attack a second time.</li>
  <li>You cannot chain “Divine Wrath” to Continuous Effects such as: “Perfect Machine King”, “Raging Flame Sprite” (either effect), “Jinzo”, “Fire Princess”, “Mad Sword Beast”, “Hayabusa Knight”, “Cat’s Ear Tribe”, “Amazoness Swords Woman”, “Harpie Lady 3”, “Fusilier Dragon the Dual-Mode Beast”, “The Fiend Megacyber”, “Blade Knight” (either effect), &quot;Patrician of Darkness&quot;, or monsters like “Element Saurus” that gain ATK continuously.</li>
  <li>You cannot activate “Divine Wrath” when “Giant Orc”, “Goblin Attack Force”, or “Spear Dragon” changes to Defense Position because these are considered Continuous Effects.</li>
  <li>You can activate “Divine Wrath” when “Lava Golem” does damage to your Life Points, but you cannot activate it when “Lava Golem” is Special Summoned.</li>
  <li>You can activate “Divine Wrath” when any Union Monster activates its effect to equip itself to another monster, because that is an Ignition Effect. However, you cannot activate “Divine Wrath” when a Union Monster Special Summons itself back as a monster, because that is an effect of an Equip Spell Card.</li>
  <li>You can activate “Divine Wrath” when a “LV” monster is sent to the Graveyard to Special Summon the next level version (an Ignition Effect), and “Divine Wrath” will negate that effect, even though it cannot destroy the “LV” monster because it is already in the Graveyard.</li>
  <li>After you negate the effect of “Sinister Serpent” with “Divine Wrath”, your opponent can activate the effect of “Sinister Serpent” again to return it to his hand, even during the same Standby Phase.</li>

  A: You declare your attack during the Battle Step. &quot;Injection Fairy Lily&quot; is a 400 attack monster at the time, so &quot;Drillago&quot; would not be to use its effect and declare a direct attack. &quot;Drillago&quot; decides to attack the &quot;Injection Fairy Lily.&quot; Even if the effect of the &quot;Injection Fairy Lily&quot; is activated in the Damage Step, &quot;Drillago&quot; will not be able to change to a direct attack. &quot;Drillago&quot; will continue battling with the &quot;Injection Fairy Lily&quot; and damage calculation will occur.

  <p>Individual Card FAQs:</p>
  <ul>
  <li>“Drillroid” can use its effect to destroy face-up and face-down Defense Position monsters that it attacks.</li>
  <li>Note that “Drillroid” does not say “without flipping the monster face-up”. The effect of “Drillroid” is applied after the monster is flipped face-up, but before damage calculation. If the Defense Position monster was face-down and has a Flip Effect, the Flip Effect will activate and resolve normally.</li>
  <li>The effect of “Drillroid” is a Trigger Effect that can be chained to.</li>
  <li>If “Drillroid” attacks a face-up “Sasuke Samurai #4”, do the coin toss for “Sasuke Samurai #4” first, at the beginning of the Damage Step. If “Sasuke Samurai #4” destroys “Drillroid” with its effect, the effect of “Drillroid” is not applied. (If “Sasuke Samurai #4” was face-down, then you miss the chance to use its effect.)</li>
  <li>If “Drillroid” attacks “Dreamsprite”, both are mandatory Trigger Effects with the same timing, so they form a chain with “Dreamsprite” as Chain Link 2. “Dreamsprite” resolves first and, according to her effect, causes damage calculation to happen immediately. Since the effect of “Drillroid” only happens without damage calculation, the effect of “Drillroid” disappears.</li>
  <li>If “Drillroid” attacks a Defense Position “D.D. Warrior Lady”, the effect of “D.D. Warrior Lady” does not activate, because she has been destroyed by the effect of “Drillroid” by the time her effect would normally activate.</li>
  <li>If “Drillroid” attacks a face-down Defense Position monster while “Final Attack Orders” is active, the monster is not destroyed because it flips face-up and immediately shifts to Attack Position.</li>
  <li>“Nightmare Penguin” will activate its effect if attacked by “Drillroid” while face-down. (Just like a Flip Effect.)</li>

  <h4 id='drop-offa-iddrop-offa'>DROP OFF<a id="DROP OFF"></a></h4>
  <p>Individual Card FAQs:</p>
  <ul>
  <li>The card discarded by the effect of &quot;Drop Off&quot; is considered to be discarded from your hand, not your Deck. If &quot;Penguin Knight&quot; is the card discarded, its effect will not activate. If &quot;Electric Snake&quot;, &quot;Regenerating Mummy&quot;, or &quot;Fear from the Dark&quot; is the card discarded, its effect will activate.</li>
  <li>This card is activated during the opponent’s Draw Phase in response to the opponent drawing a card. It is not chained to the draw.</li>
  <li>If a Quick-Play Spell Card is drawn, the opponent may activate it in a chain to &quot;Drop Off&quot; and the effect of &quot;Drop Off&quot; will disappear since the drawn card is no longer in the opponent’s hand.</li>
  <li>If the fifth and final piece of Exodia is drawn, the opponent wins before the effect of &quot;Drop Off&quot; is resolved.</li>

  <p>Individual Card FAQs:</p>
  <ul>
  <li>If “Dummy Golem” is attacked, flipped, and destroyed by damage calculation, its effect is not applied because it is destroyed. So control does not switch.</li>
  <li>If an effect like “Ring of Destruction” is chained to the Flip Effect of “Dummy Golem”, destroying “Dummy Golem”, the effect of “Dummy Golem” disappears.</li>
  <li>If the opponent only has one monster, and it is “Blindly Loyal Goblin” or “Mataza the Zapper”, and you activate the Flip Effect of “Dummy Golem”, the effect does activate and can be chained to, however its effect disappears because control of “Blindly Loyal Goblin” cannot switch.</li>
  <li>If the opponent has “Blindly Loyal Goblin” and “Gemini Elf” on the field, and you activate the Flip Effect of “Dummy Golem”, the opponent cannot select “Blindly Loyal Goblin”. They must select “Gemini Elf”.</li>
  <li>If control of monsters switches with “Dummy Golem”, it stays switched as long as the cards remain on the field. (Like “Creature Swap”.)</li>
  <li>The effect of “Dummy Golem” will NOT resolve if any of the following is true: (1) “Dummy Golem” is not on the field when the effect resolves; (2) “Dummy Golem” has been destroyed before the effect resolves, such as by damage calculation; (3) there is no opponent’s monster when the effect resolves, such as if it was returned to the hand with “Compulsory Evacuation Device”.</li>

  <p>Individual Card FAQs:</p>

  <li>You must destroy 1 Spell or Trap Card on your opponent’s side of the field to be able to Set 1 Spell or Trap Card. If your opponent chains a card to destroy the target of &quot;Dust Tornado&quot;, you cannot then Set a Spell or Trap Card because &quot;Dust Tornado&quot; did not destroy a Spell or Trap Card. If your opponent activates the card targeted by &quot;Dust Tornado&quot; it is not negated, but is still destroyed by &quot;Dust Tornado&quot; so you may Set 1 Spell or Trap Card.</li>

  <p>Netrep Rulings:</p>
  <ul>
  <li>A non Quick-play Spell Card set by the effect of “Dust Tornado” during that player’s Turn may be activated during that player’s Main Phase 1 or Main Phase 2.</li>

  <h4 id='ectoplasmera-idectoplasmera'>ECTOPLASMER<a id="ECTOPLASMER"></a></h4>
  <p>Individual Card FAQs:</p>
  <ul>
  <li>&quot;Ectoplasmer&quot; causes the turn player to Tribute during his/her End Phase, but the opponent does not Tribute. So while &quot;Ectoplasmer&quot; is out, I Tribute in my End Phase, and you Tribute in your End Phase. But I don&#39;t Tribute in yours and you don&#39;t Tribute in mine.</li>
  <li>So 1 Tribute is performed during the End Phase of each player&#39;s turn. The Tribute is performed by the turn player. (Both players have to do this during their respective End Phases, not just the controller of &quot;Ectoplasmer&quot;.)</li>
  <li>Tributing a monster for &quot;Ectoplasmer&quot; is not a cost, it’s an effect, so you can&#39;t Tribute monsters unaffected by Spell Cards.</li>
  <li>If you have a face-up monster on your side of the field during the End Phase, you have to Tribute for &quot;Ectoplasmer&quot;’s effect.</li>
  <li>You can chain &quot;Mystical Space Typhoon&quot; or &quot;Raigeki Break&quot; to &quot;Ectoplasmer&quot;&#39;s effect, and if there is no &quot;Ectoplasmer&quot; on the field, then its effect is not applied.</li>
  <li>You can activate &quot;Soul Exchange&quot; during your Main Phase and use its effect to Tribute your opponent’s monster for &quot;Ectoplasmer&quot; during the End Phase.</li>
  <li>If you Tribute your opponent’s monster that you controlled with &quot;Snatch Steal&quot; or &quot;Change of Heart&quot;, your opponent takes the damage even though it was their monster.</li>

  <li>If control of a monster equipped with &quot;Ekibyo Drakmord&quot; changes, the turn count resets. If &quot;Ekibyo Drakmord&quot; is moved by &quot;Collected Power&quot; or &quot;Tailor of the Fickle&quot; to another monster, the turn count resets.</li>
  <li>If &quot;Ekibyo Drakmord&quot; is no longer on the field, a previously equipped monster will not be destroyed on the 2nd turn after &quot;Ekibyo Drakmord&quot; was played.</li>

  <li>If there are 2 FIRE monsters on the field, Element Dragon’s ATK is 2000 (it only gets the +500 ATK bonus once, no matter how many FIRE monsters are on the field).</li>
  <li>If there is only 1 WIND monster on the field, and you attack and destroy it with &quot;Element Dragon&quot;, you cannot attack again because there is no longer a WIND monster on the field so &quot;Element Dragon&quot; no longer has that ability.</li>
  <li>Monsters that have their Attribute changed with &quot;DNA Transplant&quot; or &quot;Scroll of Bewitchment&quot; are included for &quot;Element Dragon&quot;’s effect.</li>
  <li>If there are no face-up FIRE monsters on the field, and &quot;Element Dragon&quot; attacks a face-down FIRE monster, &quot;Element Dragon&quot;’s effect that increases its ATK by 500 points is applied before damage calculation because it is a Continuous Effect.</li>

  <p>Individual Card FAQs:</p>

  <li>If both a WATER and an EARTH monster are on the field, you get both effects.</li>
  <li>If the only EARTH monster on the field is your opponent’s &quot;Giant Rat&quot;, and your &quot;Element Soldier&quot; attacks and destroys it, there is no EARTH monster on the field when &quot;Giant Rat&quot;’s effect activates in the Graveyard, so &quot;Element Soldier&quot; no longer has the ability to negate monster effects and &quot;Giant Rat&quot;’s effect resolves as normal. (Monsters destroyed by &quot;Element Soldier&quot; that have effects that activate in the Graveyard will only have their effects negated if an EARTH monster is on the field at the time the monster is sent to the Graveyard.)</li>
  <li>If there are no face-up EARTH monsters on the field, and &quot;Element Soldier&quot; attacks a face-down &quot;Man-Eater Bug&quot;, it is flipped up, and there is now an EARTH monster on the field when &quot;Man-Eater Bug&quot;’s effect would activate and resolve. So &quot;Element Soldier&quot; negates &quot;Man-Eater Bug&quot;’s effect.</li>
  <li>Monsters that have their Attribute changed with &quot;DNA Transplant&quot; or &quot;Scroll of Bewitchment&quot; are included for &quot;Element Soldier&quot;’s effect.</li>
  <li>If &quot;Element Soldier&quot; destroys &quot;Sinister Serpent&quot; while there is an EARTH monster on the field, &quot;Sinister Serpent&quot; cannot be added to your hand even if &quot;Element Soldier&quot; is removed from the field or loses its ability later on because there is no longer an EARTH monster.</li>

  <ul>
  <li>The effect of “Elemental Hero Thunder Giant” targets a monster. Discarding a card for this effect is a cost. This effect can be chained to.</li>
  <li>If a monster is equipped with “Megamorph” and its ATK is lower than that of “Elemental Hero Thunder Giant”, and the effect is activated to destroy the equipped monster, but “Mystical Space Typhoon” is chained to destroy “Megamorph”, so that the monster’s original ATK is now higher than the ATK of “Elemental Hero Thunder Giant”, the effect of “Elemental Hero Thunder Giant” disappears and the monster is not destroyed.</li>
  <li>Likewise, if the effect of “Elemental Hero Thunder Giant” is activated, targeting “King of the Skull Servants” with 2000 original ATK, and the opponent chains “Curse of Aging” and discards “Skull Servant” to activate it, then “King of the Skull Servants” has 3000 original ATK and is not destroyed.</li>

  <p>Individual Card FAQs:</p>
  <ul>
  <li>Once “Embodiment of Apophis” has been activated, it takes up 1 Monster Card Zone and 1 Spell &amp; Trap Card Zone. The physical location of “Embodiment of Apophis” should be on the Monster Card Zones, however.</li>
  <li>If your Monster Card Zones are all full you cannot activate “Embodiment of Apophis”. If your Spell &amp; Trap Card Zones are all full you cannot take control of your opponent’s “Embodiment of Apophis” because you will need 1 Monster Card Zone and 1 Spell &amp; Trap Card Zone for it.</li>
  <li>If your opponent has no vacant Spell &amp; Trap Card Zones, you cannot give them “Embodiment of Apophis” for “Creature Swap”. If “Embodiment of Apophis” is your only monster in such a case, neither player can activate “Creature Swap”.</li>
  <li>You can activate “Embodiment of Apophis” during your opponent’s Main Phase, or your own.</li>
  <li>While “Embodiment of Apophis” is a monster, it is still treated as a Trap Card and can be destroyed by “Heavy Storm” or “Mystical Space Typhoon”.</li>
  <li>If an effect that destroys Trap Cards is used against “Embodiment of Apophis”, you can use “Fake Trap” to prevent it from being destroyed. When preventing the destruction of “Embodiment of Apophis”, you must be using a card of the appropriate type. You cannot use “My Body as a Shield” to rescue it from “Heavy Storm”. You cannot use “Fake Trap” to rescue it from “Raigeki”. You can use “Riryoku Field” when “Embodiment of Apophis” is targeted by “Snatch Steal”, but not when it’s targeted by “Mystical Space Typhoon”. You can use any of these effects to protect “Embodiment of Apophis” from “Raigeki Break” because “Raigeki Break” can destroy a Monster card or a Trap Card.</li>
  <li>vs. “Jinzo”: If “Emodiment of Apophis” is a monster, and “Jinzo” or “Royal Decree” is played, “Embodiment of Apophis” cannot remain as a monster and is placed face-up in the Spell &amp; Trap Card Zone, where it remains on the field meaninglessly (even if “Jinzo” leaves play later). If “Royal Decree” is chained to the activation of “Embodiment of Apophis”, the effect of “Embodiment of Apophis” is negated and it remains on the field in the Spell &amp; Trap Card Zone meaninglessly.</li>
  <li>If “Embodiment of Apophis” attacks a face-down “Jinzo”, once “Jinzo” is flipped face-up, “Embodiment of Apophis” reverts to a Trap Card. Damage calculation is not applied.</li>
  <li>If “Embodiment of Apophis” is a monster, and is flipped face-down, it goes back to the Spell &amp; Trap Card Zone as a Trap Card (vertically, since Trap Cards do not have battle positions). You cannot activate “Embodiment of Apophis” that same turn, because it is a Trap Card that was just Set.</li>
  <li>When “Embodiment of Apophis” is sent to the Graveyard, it is sent as a Trap Card and remains treated as a Trap Card. You cannot revive it with “Monster Reborn” or retrieve it with “Return of the Doomed”. It will not trigger “Last Will”. You cannot activate “Michizure”. It will not be Special Summoned by “Red-Moon Baby”. No damage is inflicted by “KA-2 Des Scissors” or “Inferno” or “Fatal Abacus”. “Emes the Infinity” does not increase its ATK. No Life Points are increased by “Absorbing Kid from the Sky”. You would not gain Life Points for “Altar for Tribute”. (You can, however, now add it back to your hand with “Mask of Darkness”.)</li>
  <li>If your opponent controls your “Embodiment of Apophis” as a monster with “Snatch Steal” or “Creature Swap”, and it is flipped face-down, it goes to your opponent’s Spell &amp; Trap Card Zone because he is the controller.</li>
  <li>If your opponent controls your “Embodiment of Apophis” as a monster with “Snatch Steal”, and “Jinzo” is Summoned, it returns to your Spell &amp; Trap Card Zone and remains there meaninglessly. If your opponent controls your “Embodiment of Apophis” as a monster because of “Creature Swap”, and “Jinzo” is Summoned, it is placed on your opponent’s Spell &amp; Trap Card Zone and remains there meaninglessly.</li>
  <li>“Embodiment of Apophis” is considered a Normal Monster. It does not inflict damage for “Ceasefire”. You can use “Delta Attacker” if you have 3 “Embodiment of Apophis” monsters. You can Tribute “Embodiment of Apophis” for “Sword of the Soul-Eater” while it is a monster.</li>
  <li>If “Non-Spellcasting Area” is active, “Embodiment of Apophis” cannot be destroyed by “Raigeki”, etc., but can still be destroyed by “Heavy Storm” or “Mystical Space Typhoon”.</li>
  <li>“Embodiment of Apophis”, while a monster, has original ATK 1600 and original DEF 1800 (for purposes of “Megamorph”, etc.).</li>
  <li>You can negate the activation of “Embodiment of Apophis” by chaining “Solemn Judgment” or “7 Tools of the Bandit” or “Royal Oppression”, but you cannot use these against it once it is a monster.</li>
  <li>When “Embodiment of Apophis” is Special Summoned, you can activate “Torrential Tribute” just like with any other Summon.</li>
  <li>You can use “Chain Destruction” when “Embodiment of Apophis” is Special Summoned, and “Chain Destruction” will destroy all copies of “Embodiment of Apophis” in the hand and Deck even though they are Trap Cards.</li>
  <li>You can use “Embodiment of Apophis” as a Tribute once it is a monster. You cannot Tribute it for a Ritual Summon, etc., while it is in your hand.</li>
  <li>If “Embodiment of Apophis” is a monster and “Morphing Jar #2” is activated, “Embodiment of Apophis” is shuffled into the Deck as a Trap Card, so it does NOT count towards the number of monsters you need to pick up. (Also, if you pick up “Embodiment of Apophis” for the effect of “Morphing Jar #2”, it is not counted as a monster and will be one of the cards sent to the Graveyard.)</li>
  <li>If you pick up “Embodiment of Apophis” for “Cyber Jar”, it is added to your hand.</li>
  <li>If “Embodiment of Apophis” is a monster and is equipped to “Relinquished”, “Embodiment of Apophis” is treated as any other monster equipped to “Relinquished”, and “Relinquished” gets 1600 ATK and 1800 DEF.</li>
  <li>If “Embodiment of Apophis” is a monster, “Giant Trunade” will still return it to the owner’s hand.</li>
  <li>When “Embodiment of Apophis” is a monster, and is returned to the hand by “Penguin Soldier”, etc., it is returned as a Trap Card. So you cannot activate “Major Riot”.</li>
  <li>You can target “Embodiment of Apophis” with “Monster Recovery” while it is a monster, and return it to the Deck.</li>
  <li>If “Embodiment of Apophis” is a monster, and you use “Magical Hats” with it, it returns to your Spell &amp; Trap Card Zone face-down. The other effects of “Magical Hats” apply normally.</li>

  <h4 id='emergency-provisionsa-idemergency-provisionsa'>EMERGENCY PROVISIONS<a id="EMERGENCY PROVISIONS"></a></h4>
  <p>Individual Card FAQs:</p>
  <ul>
  <li>Sending Spell and Trap Cards on your side of the field to the Graveyard is a cost for activating this card.</li>
  <li>You can activate a Normal Spell Card, such as &quot;Raigeki&quot;, then chain &quot;Emergency Provisions&quot; and send &quot;Raigeki&quot; to the Graveyard to gain 1000 Life Points, and the effect of &quot;Raigeki&quot; will still resolve.</li>
  <li>If your opponent activates &quot;Heavy Storm&quot; you can chain &quot;Emergency Provisions&quot; to send your Spell and Trap Cards to Graveyard first (and gain the appropriate amount of Life Points).</li>
  <li>You gain the Life Points from this card’s effect in one lump sum, so if you control &quot;Fire Princess&quot; her effect will only inflict 500 points of damage.</li>
  <li>The effect of this card does not &quot;destroy&quot; your Spell and Trap Cards; it &quot;sends them to the Graveyard.&quot; So, for example, you may send a Spell Card to the Graveyard with a counter on it from &quot;Magic Reflector&quot;. You can also send &quot;Fusion Sword Murasame Blade&quot; even though it cannot be &quot;destroyed&quot;.</li>
  <li>If you control a monster equipped with &quot;Premature Burial&quot; and you send &quot;Premature Burial&quot; to the Graveyard to activate &quot;Emergency Provisions&quot; the equipped monster is not destroyed, because &quot;Premature Burial&quot; was not destroyed. The same is true for Toon Monsters: if you send &quot;Toon World&quot; to the Graveyard with &quot;Emergency Provisions&quot;, Toon Monsters you control are not destroyed.</li>
  <li>If you send &quot;Smoke Grenade of the Thief&quot; or &quot;Blast with Chain&quot; to the Graveyard for the cost of &quot;Emergency Provisions&quot; their effects do not activate, because they were not destroyed.</li>
  <li>If you send &quot;Black Pendant&quot; to the Graveyard for the cost of &quot;Emergency Provisions&quot; its effect does activate.</li>
  <li>While &quot;Banisher of the Light&quot; is face-up on the field, you cannot activate &quot;Emergency Provisions&quot; since it is impossible to send cards to the Graveyard.</li>
  <li>If you have &quot;Imperial Order&quot; active on your side of the field, you may send it to the Graveyard as part of the cost to activate &quot;Emergency Provisions&quot; and &quot;Emergency Provisions&quot; will not be negated.</li>

  <li>You can activate &quot;Enemy Controller&quot;&#39;s first effect even if you have no monster on your side of the field.</li>

So if your opponent activates &quot;Cannon Soldier&quot; or &quot;Chaos Emperor Dragon - Envoy of the End&quot;&#39;s effect, and you chain &quot;Enemy Controller&quot;, you still take the damage from &quot;Cannon Soldier&quot;/&quot;Chaos Emperor Dragon - Envoy of the End&quot;.</li>
  <li>If &quot;Dark Magician of Chaos&quot; is Summoned, and you chain &quot;Enemy Controller&quot; to the activation of his effect, even if you take control of &quot;Dark Magician of Chaos&quot;, you cannot take control of his effect, so the Summoner (the activator of the effect) gets to retrieve 1 Spell Card from the Graveyard.</li>
  <li>When &quot;Spirit of the Pharaoh&quot; is Special Summoned, and &quot;Enemy Controller&quot; is chained to the effect, the player who Special Summoned &quot;Spirit of the Pharaoh&quot; gets the effect because he activated the effect.</li>
  <li>If you take control of your opponent&#39;s monster with &quot;Enemy Controller&quot;, and then the monster is flipped face-down with &quot;Book of Moon&quot;, control of the monster is still returned to the opponent (the original controller) during the End Phase.</li>
  <li>If you take control of your opponent&#39;s monster with &quot;Enemy Controller&quot;, and then the monster is removed from play with &quot;Interdimensional Matter Transporter&quot; or &quot;Dimensionhole&quot;, when it returns to play it comes to the side of the field of the player who used &quot;Enemy Controller&quot;, but then immediately moves back to the original Controller.</li>

  <li>Q: Since “Exiled Force” can be summoned and tributed before the opponent can respond with something other than negating “Exiled Force,” can you chain “Torrential Tribute” to the effect of “Exiled Force?”<br>
  A: Yes you may. bishop, 12/15/2003</li>
  <li>Q: Can “Exiled Force” be the target of its own effect?<br>

  <li>Q: If “Exiled Force” is summoned to the field while there is a face-up “King Tiger Wanghu”, will the controller be able to activate the effect of “Exiled Force” before it is destroyed by the effect of “King Tiger Wanghu”?<br>
  A: This is similar to &quot;Exiled Force&quot; and &quot;Mysterious Puppeteer.&quot; The effect of &quot;King Tiger Wanghu&quot; will activate automatically when &quot;Exiled Force&quot; is summoned.

  <li>Q: How does “Freed the Matchless General” resolve in regards to “Butterfly Dagger – Elma’ and “Blast with Chain”?<br>
  A: “Freed the Matchless General’s” effect is like a built-in “Riryoku Field”. If the “Butterfly Dagger – Elma” specficially designates “Freed the Matchless General” it will be negated and destroyed by “Freed the Matchless General&#39;s” effect. It would not return to the owner&#39;s hand. “Blast with Chain” is considered a Trap Card when it chooses its target, so it can be equipped to “Freed the Matchless General.” He will not negate or destroy “Blast with Chain” when its resolves.

  <li>Q: If I equip “Fusion Sword Murasame Blade” to “Spirit Reaper,” would “Spirit Reaper” be destroyed or would this be an illegal activation?<br>
  A: You wouldn&#39;t even be able to target him with it at all. “Spirit Reaper” is not a Warrior. It would be an illegal activation in this case. If “Spirit Reaper” were turned into a Warrior through “DNA Surgery”, equipping “Fusion Sword Masamune Blade” to “Spirit Reaper” would cause “Spirit Reaper” to destroy itself through its effect.

  <li>Q: If I Summon “Gearfried the Iron Knight” and my opponent activates “Trap Hole,” and I then chain “Blast with Chain,” what happens?<br>
  A: “Blast with Chain” will equip to “Gearfried the Iron Knight.” “Gearfried the Iron Knight’s” effect would then destroy it. Next, “Trap Hole” resolves, destroying the Summoned “Gearfried the Iron Knight.” Now a new chain begins with “Blast with Chain’s” effect. You would select a card to destroy.

  <ul>
  <li>If you Tribute 1 “Gearfried the Iron Knight” to activate “Release Restraint”, then chain “Serial Spell”, you can Special Summon 2 “Gearfried the Swordmaster” cards from your Deck.</li>
  <li>The Equip Card must be successfully equipped to “Gearfried the Swordmaster” to activate his effect. For example, if “Mystical Space Typhoon” is chained to the activation of an Equip Card, it is destroyed and sent to the Graveyard before resolving, so the effect of “Gearfried the Swordmaster” does not activate.</li>
  <li>If your opponent equips “Snatch Steal” to your “Gearfried the Swordmaster”, the effect of “Snatch Steal” resolves first and control changes. Then the effect of “Gearfried the Swordmaster” activates and your opponent gets to select which monster is destroyed.</li>
  <li>The effect of “Gearfried the Swordmaster” activates when 1 or more Equip Card(s) are equipped to him. So even if “Collected Power” equips several Equip Cards to him simultaneously, you can only destroy 1 monster with his effect.</li>
  <li>The effect of “Gearfried the Swordmaster” is a Trigger Effect that can be chained to, starting a new chain after the current chain resolves. You can chain “Divine Wrath” to the activation of this effect.</li>
  <li>The effect of “Gearfried the Swordmaster” can activate even in the Damage Step. For example, if “Brain Jacker” is attacked by “Gearfried the Swordmaster”, and “Waboku” was activated earlier in the turn, “Brain Jacker” will equip to “Gearfried the Swordmaster” and the effect will activate. In this case, the effect of “Gearfried the Swordmaster” will activate after the effect of “Brain Jacker” resolves, and the controller of “Brain Jacker” will select which monster to destroy.</li>
  <li>This is a targeting effect that targets 1 monster.</li>

  <p>Netrep Q&amp;As:</p>
  <ul>
  <li>Q: Does “Germ Infection’s” decrease continue to accumulate even after the ATK has reached 0?<br>
  A: The decrease in ATK will continue to accumulate. So, if I have a &quot;White Magicial Hat&quot; equipped with &quot;Germ Infection&quot; for 4 Standby Phases, it would be receiving -1200 to its ATK. (I would treat its ATK as 0, since 1000 - 1200 = -200) If I were to equip an &quot;Axe of Despair&quot; to that same &quot;White Magicial Hat,&quot; its ATK would be 1000 + 1000 [Axe] - 1200 [Germ Infection] = 800 ATK.

  <li>A Defense Position Flip Effect Monster that is attacked will have its Flip Effect negated by &quot;Gorgon’s Eye&quot; because it remains in Defense Position.

  <li>Your opponent cannot activate &quot;Appropriate&quot; after you activate &quot;Graceful Charity&quot; since the last effect that resolves with &quot;Graceful Charity&quot; is discarding, not drawing, and your opponent misses the timing. But if your opponent already has an active &quot;Appropriate&quot; face-up on the field, he/she can draw 2 cards after you activate &quot;Graceful Charity&quot;.</li>
  <li>If &quot;Solemn Wishes&quot; is on the field when you activate &quot;Graceful Charity&quot;, you gain 500 Life Points after you finish both drawing and discarding.

  <li>Q: What happens if my opponent has 2 “Guardian Kay’est” on the field? (Can I attack directly still even though they have more than one?).<br>
  A: Having 2 &quot;Guardian Kay&#39;est&quot; is no different from just 1. Whether your opponent has 1, 2, or 3 of them on the field, you are still able to attack directly. This is assuming that they have no other monsters on the field, of course. Steve Okegawa, 02/22/04</li>
  <li>Q: If my opponent attacks one of my monsters, can I activate “Staunch Defender” and choose “Guardian Kay’est?”<br>
  A: &quot;Guardian Kay&#39;est&quot; would not be a valid target for &quot;Staunch Defender&quot; because your opponent cannot attack &quot;Guardian Kay&#39;est.&quot; This is due to the effect of &quot;Guardian Kay&#39;est.&quot; Curtis Schultz, 02/04/2004</li>

  <p>Individual Card FAQs:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Missing the Timing: Suppose you have 3 copies of “Heart of the Underdog” on the field, and draw a Normal Monster Card during your Draw Phase. All 3 copies of “Heart of the Underdog” immediately activate their effects, and because they activate simultaneously, they form a chain with Chain Links 1, 2, and 3. If you draw a Normal Monster card for Chain Link 3 or Chain Link 2, your copies of “Heart of the Underdog” do not activate again. This is because they are “when… you can” optional Trigger Effects, and you “miss the timing” because you drew the Normal Monster Card during a chain and not as Chain Link 1. However, if you draw a Normal Monster Card for Chain Link 1, all 3 copies of “Heart of the Underdog” will activate their effects again.</li>
    <li>“Heart of the Underdog” doesn’t only activate if you draw a Normal Monster Card for your standard draw. It will also activate its effect if you draw a Normal Monster Card with a card effect such as “Reload”, “Jar of Greed”, or “Heart of the Underdog”.</li>
    <li>When you draw a Normal Monster Card, if you want to activate the effect of “Heart of the Underdog” you have to show it to your opponent immediately. You can’t do anything else in between.</li>
    <li>A Normal Monster Card means a yellow card with no effect. A Ritual Monster with no effect is not a Normal Monster Card. A card like “Blue-Eyes Toon Dragon” is not a Normal Monster Card.</li>
    <li>When you show a Normal Monster Card to your opponent to activate “Heart of the Underdog”, your opponent can chain “Drop Off”. You will have to discard that Normal Monster Card, but “Heart of the Underdog” still resolves its effect.</li>
    <li>If you draw multiple cards at the same time during your Draw Phase, such as with “Reload”, only 1 of the cards needs to be a Normal Monster to trigger “Heart of the Underdog”, since they are all drawn at the same time. If you activate “Reload” in your Draw Phase and draw 5 Normal Monster Cards, your “Heart of the Underdog” only activates 1 time because it says “card(s)”.</li>

  <p>Individual Card FAQs:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Note that &quot;Heavy Mech Support Platform&quot; is different from other Union Monsters in that its last sentence is applied if the monster it is equipped to is destroyed (period), not just when the monster is destroyed as a result of battle. This extra effect does not apply to previous Union Monsters.</li>
    <li>If a monster equipped with &quot;Heavy Mech Support Platform&quot; is targeted by &quot;Ring of Destruction&quot;, then &quot;Heavy Mech Support Platform&quot; is destroyed instead of the equipped monster, and the damage inflicted to both players by &quot;Ring of Destruction&quot; is 0 (because the monster targeted by &quot;Ring of Destruction&quot; was not destroyed by it).</li>
    <li>If you have a monster, &quot;X-Head Cannon&quot; for example, equipped with &quot;Heavy Mech Support Platform&quot;, and you activate &quot;Limiter Removal&quot;, the ATK will becomes (1800 + 500) x 2 = 4600. Also, the &quot;Heavy Mech Support Platform&quot; will be destroyed instead of the &quot;X-Head Cannon&quot; during the End Phase (by the effect of &quot;Limiter Removal&quot;).</li>
    <li>If &quot;Heavy Mech Support Platform&quot; is equipped to &quot;Big Core&quot; or &quot;Reflect Bounder&quot; and they would be destroyed by their effect, &quot;Heavy Mech Support Platform&quot; is destroyed instead.</li>
    <li>If “Reflect Bounder” equipped with “Heavy Mech Support Platform” is attacked by “Dark Ruler Ha Des”, during damage calculation “Heavy Mech Support Platform” is destroyed instead of “Reflect Bounder”. Then, after damage calculation, “Reflect Bounder” will destroy itself by its own effect. Its effect is not negated, because it was not destroyed by “Dark Ruler Ha Des”.</li>

    A: Exactly 2 are declared at the time of activation. No more and no less can be chosen. If your opponent activates “Disappear” and chooses 1 of the two spells you had selected, the remaining spell would still be placed into the Deck per the card&#39;s effect. Curtis Schultz, 12/10/2003</li>

If your opponent selects &quot;Horus the Black Flame Dragon&quot; as a target (with &quot;Ring of Destruction&quot;, for example), and you chain &quot;Call of the Haunted&quot; to Special Summon &quot;Horus’ Servant&quot;, then &quot;Horus the Black Flame Dragon&quot; will still be destroyed by &quot;Ring of Destruction&quot; because &quot;Horus’ Servant&quot; is being Special Summoned AFTER &quot;Horus the Black Flame Dragon&quot; was selected.

  <ul>
    <li>Q: In the event that the player has the exact amount of LP to pay for “Imperial Order,” they would be destroyed because paying for them would reduce the player&#39;s LP to zero?<br>
    A: This card does not have mandatory payments. The player controlling it can opt not to pay and the card would then be destroyed. They cannot choose to pay if it would make their Life Points become 0. Curtis Schultz, 12/23/2003</li>
    <li>Q: If one opponent activates “Limiter Removal” and the other chains with “Imperial Order,” would the monsters not get the power up but still die.<br>
    A: “Imperial Order” negates all of “Limiter Removal&#39;s” effects. But if you use “Limiter Removal,” attack, and then activate “Imperial Order” during Main Phase 2, the machines are STILL destroyed. bishop, 12/05/2003</li>
    <li>Q: Why is a card’s turn count ability (“Swords of Revealing Light”, “Final Countdown”, etc.) not considered part of its effect when being negated with “Imperial Order”?<br>
    A: “Imperial Order”’s presence on the field does not mean that the count of anything (phase, turn, etc) stops. bishop, 01/16/2004</li>
    <li>Q: My opponent plays “Prohibition” and declares “Mystical Space Typhoon” and I chain “Imperial Order” to the activation; since “Imperial Order” just negates (not destroys) the “Prohibition” remains on the field and once “Imperial Order” leaves the field, it’s effect kicks in and “Mystical Space Typhoon” cannot be played. Is this true?<br>
    A: That is correct. When “Imperial Order” is negated or destroyed, the effect of “Prohibition” will resume being in effect and would then prohibit the declared card, “Mystical Space Typhoon” in this case. Curtis Schultz, 04/20/2004</li>

    <li>Your opponent can still Flip Summon a monster.</li>
    <li>If there are already more monsters on your opponent&#39;s side of the field when you activate &quot;Kaiser Colosseum&quot;, nothing happens to your opponent&#39;s monsters but your opponent cannot Summon any more. Also, if the number of monsters controlled by &quot;Kaiser Colosseum&quot;&#39;s controller is reduced, the opponent does not have to remove any of his monsters.</li>
    <li>Your opponent cannot use &quot;Monster Reborn&quot;, &quot;Scapegoat&quot;, etc. while &quot;Kaiser Colosseum&quot; prevents him from placing new monsters. However, your opponent CAN use &quot;Change of Heart&quot;, &quot;Snatch Steal&quot;, etc.</li>

    <li>When &quot;Kaiser Colosseum&quot; is active, and &quot;Cyber Jar&quot; is activated, if your opponent would control more monsters than you, your opponent has to destroy monsters equal to the difference; the excess monsters are never actually Summoned and instead are sent from the Deck to the Graveyard (so &quot;Witch of the Black Forest&quot; does not get its effect, etc.).

  </ul>
  <p>Netrep Q&amp;As:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Q: Would “Messenger of Peace” effectively stop “Karate Man” from using his effect?<br>
    A: “Karate Man&#39;s” effect is Spell Speed 1, and it can only be activated during one of your own Main Phases. Since “Karate Man&#39;s” ATK would be over 1500 before you declare the attack, you definitely cannot attack after using “Karate Man&#39;s” effect if “Messenger of Peace” is on the field. Similarly, as “Karate Man” is a Spell Speed 1 effect, it cannot be used during the opponent&#39;s turn at all. So, if a “Gemini Elf” (for example) attacks your “Karate Man,” you don&#39;t get to use the effect and “Karate Man” is destroyed from battle. Steve Okegawa, 01/07/2004</li>

    <li>If a monster’s ATK when it is Summoned is less than 1400 due to the effect of other cards, such as a Field Spell Card that reduces its ATK, it is destroyed by &quot;King Tiger Wanghu&quot;’s effect (so apply all existing modifiers before determining if the monster is destroyed). If &quot;Command Knight&quot; is Summoned, it increases its own ATK to 1600 before &quot;King Tiger Wanghu&quot; can destroy it.</li>
    <li>If &quot;King Tiger Wanghu&quot; is Normal Summoned or Special Summoned, and its own ATK is reduced below 1400 by a pre-existing effect, then it destroys itself when Summoned. (Example: &quot;King Tiger Wanghu&quot; and &quot;Bladefly&quot; are Special Summoned simultaneously by &quot;Cyber Jar&quot;. &quot;King Tiger Wanghu&quot;’s ATK is 1300, and it is destroyed by its own effect (and &quot;Bladefly&quot; is also destroyed by &quot;King Tiger Wanghu&quot;’s effect).</li>

That is all that happens when “Last Turn” resolves. After that, the turn player Special Summons 1 monster from their Deck. After that, a special Battle Phase occurs. Then, during the End Phase, the victory check of “Last Turn” is applied. “Last Turn” sets up several effects that resolve later in the turn long after the Trap Card itself has resolved. Several other cards do this too, like “Last Will” and “Change of Heart”.</li>
    <li>Suppose that “Ceasefire” is activated (Chain Link 1), and “Last Turn” is chained to it (Chain Link 2). In this case, “Last Turn” resolves first, the activating player selects 1 monster on their side of the field, and all other cards are sent to the Graveyard. Then resolve the effect of “Ceasefire” (Chain Link 1). After “Ceasefire” resolves, the turn player Special Summons a monster for “Last Turn”, then the special Battle Phase occurs, then in the End Phase the victory check is applied. This is an example of how the special nature of “Last Turn” works: the only thing that happens when “Last Turn” resolves is to select 1 monster and send all other cards to the Graveyard.</li>
    <li>“Last Turn” is not a card that Special Summons a monster when it resolves. Therefore you can activate “Last Turn” even while “Jowgen the Spiritualist” is face-up on the field. If the player activating “Last Turn” controls “Jowgen the Spiritualist” and selects it as the monster to keep, the opponent cannot Special Summon for “Last Turn”, and there will be no special Battle Phase. However the victory check is still applied in the End Phase.</li>
    <li>The special Battle Phase for “Last Turn” happens right after the monster is Special Summoned. It is in addition to the normal Battle Phase and does not disrupt the normal order of the turn. For example, if “Last Turn” is activated during the Draw Phase, resolves the effect, Special Summon, initiate the special Battle Phase, then continue with the Draw Phase. The turn player can have a normal Battle Phase later in the turn.</li>
    <li>The special Battle Phase is treated like a standard Battle Phase in every other way, with a Start Step, Battle Step, Damage Step, and End Step. Only the selected monster and the Special Summoned monster can battle.</li>
    <li>If you activate “Last Turn” and select your “The Rock Spirit” or “Soul of Purity and Light” their effects will be applied during your opponent’s special Battle Phase. Also any Flip Effects are resolved as normal, etc. You can use the effect of “Injection Fairy Lily” and other monster effects during the special Battle Phase.</li>
    <li>The effect that reduces Battle Damage to zero applies only for the special Battle Phase, not for the normal Battle Phase. Example: A player activates “Last Turn” and selects their Defense Position “Spirit Reaper”. The turn player Special Summons “Enraged Battle Ox” and attacks in the special Battle Phase, but no damage occurs. However, during the turn player’s normal Battle Phase they can attack again, and will inflict 1500 points of damage due to the effect of “Enraged Battle Ox”, so the opponent’s Life Points will be zero and the turn player will win.</li>
    <li>If the Battle Phase is skipped because of “Thunder of Ruler” or “Soul Exchange”, resolve the effects of “Last Turn” as much as possible (including victory check, quite possibly resulting in a DRAW).</li>
    <li>You can chain to the activation of “Last Turn” with cards like “Ring of Destruction”, “Offerings to the Doomed”, or “Compulsory Evacuation Device” to eliminate the opponent’s monsters. If the player who activated “Last Turn” has no monsters on the field when it resolves, the effects of “Last Turn” are not negated. So the turn player still Special Summons a monster, although the special Battle Phase is not conducted, but the victory check in the End Phase is still performed.</li>
    <li>The victory check for “Last Turn” is an effect that must be resolved by the player who activated it. The turn player still has priority to activate and resolve any other effects first. You cannot chain to the victory check of “Last Turn”.</li>
    <li>If your opponent activates “Last Turn” and you Special Summon “Dark Magician of Chaos” from your Deck, you can activate his effect to add a Spell Card from your Graveyard to your hand.</li>
    <li>After “Last Turn” sends all cards to the Graveyard, before the Special Summon for “Last Turn” is performed, monster effects like “Despair from the Dark”, “Elephant Statue of Disaster”, and “Regenerating Mummy” will activate.</li>
    <li>If “Night Assailant” is sent from the hand to the Graveyard by the effect of “Last Turn”, resolve the effect of “Night Assailant” before Special Summoning for “Last Turn”.</li>
    <li>If your opponent activates “Last Turn” and you Special Summon a monster that can attack twice, it can attack twice during the special Battle Phase (important if the opponent had a monster like “Big Core”).</li>
    <li>“Last Turn” as a chain to “Change of Heart”: Suppose the turn player activates “Change of Heart” and the opponent chains “Last Turn”, then the opponent selects the monster targeted by “Change of Heart” for “Last Turn” (since it’s still on his side of the field, as “Change of Heart” hasn’t resolved yet). Then “Change of Heart” resolves and the turn player gains control of the monster, then Special Summons for “Last Turn”. There is no special Battle Phase. Assuming that the opponent somehow survives the standard Battle Phase, during the End Phase, the turn player has priority to activate and resolve an effect. If the turn player activates and resolves “Change of Heart”, then the monster goes back to the opponent and (assuming nothing else has happened), both players each have 1 monster and the result is a DRAW. If the turn player passes priority to the opponent, the opponent can activate and resolve the effect of “Last Turn” before “Change of Heart”, and in this case the turn player still has 2 monsters and the opponent has zero, so the turn player would win. If the turn player passed priority to the opponent and the opponent passes it back, the turn player MUST activate and resolve an effect, so the effect of “Change of Heart” would expire and both players would have 1 monster each, resulting in a DRAW.</li>
    <li>You cannot Special Summon a monster for “Last Turn” that is a “Special Summon-only” monster like “Chaos Emperor Dragon – Envoy of the End”, “Dark Necrofear”, or “Ocean Dragon Lord – Neo-Daedalus”. Nor can you select a Spirit Monster because they cannot be Special Summoned.</li>
    <li>You CAN Special Summon a high-level monster that has no Special Summoning restrictions for “Last Turn”, such as “Blue-Eyes White Dragon” or “Dark Magician of Chaos”.</li>
    <li>If you activate “Last Turn” and select your face-up “Thousand-Eyes Restrict”, the turn player cannot attack so unless they can destroy your “Thousand-Eyes Restrict” with a card effect, each of you will have a monster during the End Phase and the Duel will end in a DRAW.</li>
    <li>While your Life Points are 1000 or less, you can activate “Last Turn” in any part of your opponent’s turn, except the Damage Step. You can even activate it during the End Phase.</li>
    <li>If “Last Turn” is activated and the turn player has no monsters to Summon, there is no battle however the victory check is still applied.</li>
    <li>If you activate “Last Turn” during the Draw Phase or Standby Phase, and select your face-up “Jowgen the Spiritualist”, your opponent can still retrieve their “Sinister Serpent”, Summon it normally in Main Phase 1, and attack and destroy “Jowgen the Spiritualist” in the normal Battle Phase, then win the Duel in the End Phase because of the victory check of “Last Turn”.</li>
    <li>If “Jinzo” is Special Summoned by the effect of “Last Turn”, “Jinzo” does not negate the special Battle Phase or victory check because “Last Turn” has already resolved and been sent to the Graveyard, so it is no longer on the field for “Jinzo” to negate.</li>
    <li>If a player’s Life Points are reduced to zero during the special Battle Phase of “Last Turn”, or afterwards during the normal course of the turn, then that player loses. Example: “Giant Germ” is Special Summoned by the turn player and is destroyed as a result of battle, and the opponent had 500 or fewer Life Points when activating “Last Turn”.</li>
    <li>If you activate “Last Turn” and then your Life Points increase above 1000 later, the effects of “Last Turn” are still applied.</li>
    <li>If the turn player Special Summons “Mystic Tomato” for “Last Turn”, and attacks, and “Mystic Tomato” is destroyed, its effect activates and a monster is Special Summoned, but that new monster cannot attack during the special Battle Phase. (But it can attack during the standard Battle Phase.)</li>
    <li>If the turn player Special Summons “Sangan” for “Last Turn”, and “Sangan” is destroyed during the special Battle Phase, then its effect is resolved. If the turn player hasn’t Normal Summoned a monster that turn, they can Summon the monster retrieved with “Sangan” during their Main Phase (and attack during their standard Battle Phase). This can result in a DRAW.</li>
    <li>If you activate “Last Turn” and select your “Dark Necrofear”, and it’s destroyed during the special Battle Phase, you can select which effect resolves first during the End Phase: “Dark Necrofear” or “Last Turn”. So you can choose to resolve “Dark Necrofear” first, equip it to your opponent’s monster and take control of it, then resolve “Last Turn” and win because only you control a monster.</li>
    <li>Vs. “Sanga of the Thunder”, “Kazejin”, “Suijin”: If the turn player Special Summons any of these monsters for “Last Turn”, he cannot activate the effect. However, if the player who activates “Last Turn” selects one of these monsters, he can activate the effect during the special Battle Phase.</li>
    <li>The monster selected by the player activating “Last Turn” can be face-up or face-down, in Attack or Defense Position.</li>
    <li>If the turn player Special Summons “Twin-Headed Behemoth” and it is destroyed during the special Battle Phase, during the End Phase the turn player has priority to activate and resolve an effect first, so he can choose the effect of “Twin-Headed Behemoth” and Special Summon it to the field before the victory check of “Last Turn”.</li>
    <li>If the effect of “Non Aggression Area” is being applied and you activate “Last Turn”, your opponent does not Special Summon from the Deck for “Last Turn”.</li>
    <li>“Last Turn” does not target so you can select monsters like “Tyrant Dragon” and “Fiend Skull Dragon” for its effect, or a Dragon-Type monster while “King Dragun” or “Lord of D.” is on the field. You can select “Spirit Reaper” and it will not be destroyed by its effect.</li>
    <li>You can activate “Last Turn” and select your opponent’s monster that you control with “Snatch Steal”. However, after selecting it, “Snatch Steal” is sent to the Graveyard so control of the monster returns to the turn player. The turn player then Special Summons for “Last Turn” but no special Battle Phase is conducted. The victory check is still conducted in the End Phase.</li>
    <li>If you activate “Last Turn” and select a monster that was Special Summoned by “Call of the Haunted”, when “Call of the Haunted” is sent to the Graveyard by “Last Turn”, your selected monster is destroyed. But if you selected a monster Special Summoned by “Premature Burial”, the selected monster is not destroyed when “Premature Burial” is sent to the Graveyard by “Last Turn”.</li>
    <li>If both monsters that battle for “Last Turn” are removed from play (such as with “D.D. Warrior Lady”) then the result is a DRAW.</li>
    <li>If “Obnoxious Celtic Guard” battles a monster for “Last Turn”, its effect is applied and it is not destroyed if it battles a monster with 1900 or higher ATK.</li>
    <li>“Waboku” can be activated before “Last Turn”, or be chained to the activation of “Last Turn”, and in either case the effect of “Waboku” will prevent the activator’s monster from being destroyed. This can lead to a DRAW.</li>
    <li>If the turn player activated “Last Will” before “Last Turn” was activated, a monster can be Special Summoned by the effect of “Last Will” during the special Battle Phase (but it cannot attack during the special Battle Phase).</li>
    <li>You can activate “Wall of Revealing Light” (paying its cost) and chain “Last Turn”.</li>
    <li>If “Pyramid of Light”, “Andro Sphinx”, and “Sphinx Teleia” are all sent to the Graveyard by “Last Turn”, “Theinen the Great Sphinx” is not Special Summoned because the effect of “Pyramid of Light” activates its effect, but then looks for “Andro Sphinx” and “Sphinx Teleia” and does not find them on the field, so it cannot destroy them with its effect.</li>
    <li>If the battle for “Last Turn” is conducted and the defending monster was “Wall of Illusion”, but it is destroyed, the attacking monster is returned to the turn player’s hand. The turn player can then Normal Summon the monster in the Main Phase (unless it has passed).</li>

  <h4 id='last-willa-idlast-willa'>LAST WILL<a id="LAST WILL"></a></h4>
  <p>Individual Card FAQs:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>You don’t select a monster as a target when you activate or resolve &quot;Last Will&quot;. &quot;Last Will&quot; creates a state whereby, the next time during that turn when your monster is sent from your side of the field to your Graveyard, you may Special Summon 1 monster from your Deck using &quot;Last Will’s&quot; state. &quot;Last Will’s&quot; state then ends.</li>
    <li>These states accumulate, so if you activate 2 &quot;Last Wills&quot;, then the next time during that turn when your monster is sent from your side of the field to your Graveyard, you may Special Summon 2 monsters from your Deck, and the &quot;Last Wills’&quot; states then end.</li>
    <li>You only Special Summon 1 monster for each 1 &quot;Last Will&quot;.</li>
    <li>The state will expire at the end of the turn, or when it is used, whichever comes first. So if you Special Summon using &quot;Last Will’s&quot; state, then the state is gone, and if the end of the turn arrives without using &quot;Last Will’s&quot; state, then the state is gone.</li>
    <li>Last Will’s state will trigger by Tributing for a Tribute Summon, or for &quot;Cannon Soldier’s&quot; effect, etc.</li>
    <li>You can use &quot;Last Will’s&quot; state to Special Summon a Level 5 or higher monster like &quot;Labyrinth Wall&quot;.</li>
    <li>You cannot Special Summon a &quot;Special Summon-only&quot; monster. You CAN Special Summon &quot;Toon Mermaid&quot; with &quot;Last Will&#39;s&quot; effect, as long as you have &quot;Toon World&quot; on your side of the field.</li>
    <li>&quot;Last Will’s&quot; state is only triggered when your OWN monster is sent from YOUR side of the field to YOUR Graveyard.</li>
    <li>If &quot;Last Will’s&quot; state is triggered during the Battle Phase by your monster being sent to your Graveyard, you resolve &quot;Last Will’s&quot; effect at that time (just like &quot;Giant Rat&quot;) and the newly Summoned monster can attack before Main Phase 2.</li>
    <li>If &quot;Imperial Order&quot; is activated after &quot;Last Will&quot; has resolved, it will not negate &quot;Last Will&#39;s&quot; state.</li>
    <li>You can Special Summon a 1500 ATK monster that will have higher than 1500 ATK after being Summoned, such as a Fiend with 1500 original ATK while &quot;Yami&quot; is on the field and its ATK once Summoned will be 1700.</li>
    <li>You can Special Summon &quot;Muka Muka&quot; even if you have 6 cards in your hand and &quot;Muka Muka&#39;s&quot; ATK, once Summoned, will be higher than 1500.</li>

    <li>If &quot;Legacy Hunter&quot; attacks a face-down &quot;Man-Eater Bug&quot; or &quot;Cyber Jar&quot;, &quot;Legacy Hunter&quot;&#39;s effect is not applied because &quot;Legacy Hunter&quot;&#39;s effect activates when the monster he destroyed is sent to the Graveyard, and &quot;Legacy Hunter&quot; will no longer be on the field in these instances.</li>
    <li>The monster that &quot;Legacy Hunter&quot; attacks must be face-down at the start of the Damage Step for &quot;Legacy Hunter&#39;s&quot; effect to activate. So if &quot;Legacy Hunter&quot; attacks a face-down Defense Position monster and your opponent activates &quot;Ceasefire&quot; to flip the monster face-up, &quot;Legacy Hunter’s&quot; effect is NOT applied.

    <li>&quot;The total Life Points you paid&quot; is defined as the Life Points paid for costs (both activation costs and maintenance costs) of cards. It does not include damage or loss of Life Points. Damage is not included even if the damage was caused by an effect you control, such as if you activate &quot;Ring of Destruction&quot;.</li>
    <li>&quot;In your last turn&quot; is defined as the period from the start of your previous turn’s Draw Phase to the end of that turn’s End Phase. Cost that you paid during your opponent’s turn that occurred between your last turn and the current turn are not included.</li>
    <li>The effect of &quot;Life Absorbing Machine&quot; increases your Life Points for each cost you paid separately. So if you had &quot;Fire Princess&quot; on the field, and you paid 2 costs during your last turn, &quot;Fire Princess&quot; will deal 1000 points of damage to the opponent.</li>
    <li>&quot;Life Absorbing Machine&quot; does not have to be active at the time the Life Points were paid. If you pay a cost of 2000 Life Points during your turn, then activate &quot;Life Absorbing Machine&quot; during your opponent’s turn, the effect of &quot;Life Absorbing Machine&quot; will increase your Life Points by 1000 during your Standby Phase.</li>
    <li>Example: It is your turn. During your Standby Phase you pay 500 Life Points for your &quot;Terrorking Archfiend&quot;. During your Main Phase 1 you activate &quot;Life Absorbing Machine&quot;. Then you activate &quot;Delinquent Duo&quot; and pay 1000 Life Points for its cost. You Set &quot;Seven Tools of the Bandit&quot; and end your turn. During your opponent’s turn they activate &quot;Reinforcements&quot; and you chain &quot;Seven Tools of the Bandit&quot; to negate and destroy it. Your opponent ends their turn. During your Standby Phase the effect of &quot;Life Absorbing Machine&quot; increases your Life Points by 250 (half of &quot;Terrorking Archfiend&quot;’s cost) then again by 500 (half of &quot;Delinquent Duo&quot;’s cost).</li>
    <li>If you have two copies of &quot;Life Absorbing Machine&quot; on the field, their effects are cumulative.</li>

  <p>Individual Card FAQs:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>You can activate (flip face-up) this card at any time; it does not need to be activated in response to a Summon.</li>
    <li>The effect of this card applies to both players, and does not affect monsters that are already on the field face-down. These monsters remain face-down until flipped face-up as normal.</li>
    <li>While this card is on the field, monsters can be Normal Summoned in face-up Defense Position, and can be the target of &quot;Trap Hole&quot; and will trigger effects like the effect of &quot;Mysterious Puppeteer&quot;.</li>
    <li>While this card is on the field, if a monster would be Special Summoned in face-down Defense Position (such as with &quot;Cyber Jar&quot; or &quot;Nimble Momonga&quot;), it is instead Special Summoned in face-up Defense Position.</li>

  <h4 id='lone-wolfa-idlone-wolfa'>LONE WOLF<a id="LONE WOLF"></a></h4>
  <p>Individual Card FAQs:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>If you activate “Lone Wolf” targeting an appropriate monster, and later you Summon another monster, the effect of “Lone Wolf” is still applied.</li>
    <li>If you target “Monk Fighter”, etc. with “Lone Wolf”, and “Monk Fighter” is later flipped face-down, the effect of “Lone Wolf” disappears and is not re-activated even if “Monk Fighter” is later flipped face-up again.</li>
    <li>“Your opponent’s monster effects” on “Lone Wolf” means “the effects of monsters that your opponent controls”. So if your opponent uses “Monster Reborn” on your “Exiled Force”, they still cannot Tribute “Exiled Force” to destroy your “Monk Fighter” targeted by “Lone Wolf”.</li>
    <li>If you Summon “Monk Fighter” and target it with “Lone Wolf”, and your opponent controls “Bug-Tusked Mammoth”, you can still attack that same turn with “Monk Fighter”.</li>
    <li>If your “Master Monk” targeted with “Lone Wolf” attacks and destroys “D.D. Assailant”, “D.D. Assailant” is removed from play but “Master Monk” is not.</li>
    <li>If your opponent Summons “Dark Jeroid” and reduces your “Monk Fighter” ATK by 800 points, then later you activate “Lone Wolf” targeting the “Monk Fighter”, it does not restore the ATK of “Monk Fighter”.</li>
    <li>Your “Monk Fighter” targeted by “Lone Wolf” cannot be destroyed by the effect of “Tribe-Infecting Virus”. Furthermore, if it is the only monster on your side of the field, your opponent cannot discard cards to activate “Tribe-Infecting Virus” to destroy Rock-Type monsters, because it will have no effect.</li>
    <li>If you have “Monk Fighter” targeted by “Lone Wolf”, the following are examples of monster effects that will NOT be negated because they are not applied to a monster: “Airknight Parshath” (damage is inflicted and a card is drawn), “Fiber Jar” (“Monk Fighter” is shuffled into the Deck), “Maju Garzett” (the ATK of “Maju Garzett” does not become 0), “Susa Soldier” (the damage to Life Points is still halved), “Dark Magician Girl” (her ATK is still increased by her effect), “Stone Statue of the Aztecs” (Battle Damage to your Life Points is doubled), “Amazoness Fighter” (opponent’s Battle Damage to their Life Points is still zero), “Amazoness Swords Woman” (Battle Damage is still redirected), and “Reflect Bounder” (you still take effect damage to your Life Points).</li>
    <li>“Archfiend of Gilfer” and “Dark Necrofear” in the Graveyard can activate their effects and target “Monk Fighter” targeted by “Lone Wolf”. This is because they activate as Monster Cards, equip to the target monster, become treated as Equip Spell Cards, and THEN apply their effects (by which point they are now treated as Equip Spell Cards).</li>
    <li>The effect of “Lone Wolf” will be negated by Jinzo even if targeting “Monk Fighter”.</li>

  <h4 id='lord-of-da-idlord-of-da'>LORD OF D.<a id="LORD OF D."></a></h4>
  <p>Individual Card FAQs:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>&quot;Lord of D.&quot; cannot negate effects; he only prevents Dragon-Type monsters from being selected as targets of effects. Once a target has been selected, the effect of &quot;Lord of D.&quot; is irrelevant.</li>
    <li>If your opponent activates &quot;Ring of Destruction&quot; targeting your &quot;Lord of D.&quot; and you chain &quot;D. Tribe&quot; to change &quot;Lord of D.&quot; to Dragon-Type, &quot;Ring of Destruction&quot; will still resolve and destroy &quot;Lord of D.&quot; since he was selected as a target before he was changed into Dragon-Type. If your opponent activates &quot;Ring of Destruction&quot; targeting a Dragon-Type monster you control and you chain &quot;Call of the Haunted&quot; to Special Summon &quot;Lord of D.&quot; from your Graveyard, your Dragon-Type monster is still destroyed for the same reason.</li>
    <li>If you have &quot;Lord of D.&quot; on the field, and activate &quot;Premature Burial&quot; to Special Summon a Dragon-Type monster from your Graveyard, that is okay, but if your opponent later destroys &quot;Premature Burial&quot; your Dragon-Type monster is also destroyed because &quot;Premature Burial&quot; is NOT selecting your Dragon-Type as a target.</li>
    <li>While you have &quot;Lord of D.&quot; on the field you cannot equip your Dragon-Type monsters with Equip Spell Cards, but if you already have a Dragon-Type monster equipped with an Equip Spell Card when you Summon &quot;Lord of D.&quot;, the Equip Spell card is not destroyed or negated, because &quot;Lord of D.&quot; only prevents Dragon-Type monsters from being selected as a target.</li>
    <li>&quot;Lord of D.&quot; will NOT stop &quot;Dark Hole&quot;, &quot;Mirror Force&quot;, &quot;Raigeki&quot;, &quot;Fissure&quot;, &quot;Smashing Ground&quot;, &quot;Hammer Shot&quot;, or &quot;Amazoness Archers&quot;, nor will he protect your Dragon-Type monsters from their effects, since these cards affect the whole field and do not select targets.</li>

  <h4 id='lost-guardiana-idlost-guardiana'>LOST GUARDIAN<a id="LOST GUARDIAN"></a></h4>
  <p>Individual Card FAQs:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Whenever the number of your monsters removed from play changes, re-calculate the DEF of “Lost Guardian”. (Just like “Shadow Ghoul”, etc.)</li>
    <li>When a monster is removed from play, it goes to a “removed zone” (for lack of a better term) of the original owner. If the opponent controlled it, it will return to the opponent’s side of the field when it returns to player, however it is considered to be in the original owner’s “removed zone” while out of play. This is important for effects such as “Lost Guardian”.</li>
    <li>Example: Player A controls 2 monsters. Player B activates “Change of Heart” to take control of one of them, then activates “Different Dimension Gate” to remove both from play. Both monsters are in Player A’s “removed zone” while removed from play (so Player A’s “Lost Guardian” would have 1400 DEF). When “Different Dimension Gate” is destroyed, the monster Player B took control of will return to Player B’s side of the field (if possible, if not it is destroyed) before returning to Player A’s side of the field.</li>
    <li>Monsters removed from play and kept face-down, like with “Different Dimension Capsule” or “Lightforce Sword”, do NOT count towards the DEF of “Lost Guardian”.</li>

    <li>If the attack target of &quot;Luminous Soldier&quot; is redirected to a DARK monster by the effect of &quot;Dreamsprite&quot; the ATK of &quot;Luminous Soldier&quot; will then increase by 500 points.</li>

    <li>The Machine-Type monster is chosen at activation of this card, so if the opponent chains &quot;Ring of Destruction&quot; to destroy the chosen monster, up to 2 copies of that card can still be Special Summoned.</li>

  <h4 id='mage-powera-idmage-powera'>MAGE POWER<a id="MAGE POWER"></a></h4>
  <p>Individual Card FAQs:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>&quot;Mage Power&quot; includes itself, Field Spell Cards on your side of the field, and monsters acting like Equip Spell Cards, such as Union Monsters.</li>
    <li>If you control &quot;Cannon Soldier&quot; equipped with &quot;Mage Power&quot;, and you activate &quot;Limiter Removal&quot;, then the ATK of &quot;Cannon Soldier&quot; is (1400 + 500 + 500) x 2 = 4800.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>Netrep Rulings:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>&quot;Mage Power&quot; counts itself toward its effect. (Example: if you Equip this Spell Card to your monster and &quot;Mage Power&quot; is the only Spell Card in your Spell and Trap Card Zone, the equipped monster would increase its ATK and DEF by 500 points.)</li>
    <li>A Field Spell Card in your Field Spell Card Zone is included in the effect of your &quot;Mage Power.</li>
    <li>It does not matter if the Spell and/or Trap card(s) on your side of the field are face-up or face-down.</li>
    <li>The only Spell and Trap cards included in the effect of &quot;Mage Power&quot; are the ones controlled by the person that is in control of the &quot;Mage Power.&quot; If your opponent takes control of your monster that is equipped with your &quot;Mage Power,&quot; &quot;Mage Power&quot; would still only count the Spell and Trap Cards on your side of the field. So if I have a Gemini Elf equipped with &quot;Mage Power&quot; and 2 Set Spell/Trap Cards and my opponent takes control of the equipped &quot;Gemini Elf,&quot; they would not count how many Spell and Trap cards are on their side of the field. Only the ones on my side of the field would be included in the effect of &quot;Mage Power.&quot;</li>

    <li>Monsters that may attack twice during the Battle Phase, such as &quot;Hayabusa Knight&quot;, that have their first attack negated by the effect of &quot;Magic Cylinder&quot; may still make a second attack.</li>
    <li>If the attack of &quot;Goblin Attack Force&quot; or &quot;Spear Dragon&quot; is negated by the effect of &quot;Magic Cylinder&quot;, they will not be changed to Defense Position, since Damage Calculation never occurred.</li>
    <li>The Damage caused by this card’s effect is equal to the current ATK of the attacking monster.</li>
    <li>If an effect is chained to &quot;Magic Cylinder&quot; that destroys the attacking monster, or removes the attacking monster from the turn player’s side of the field (including switching it to your control, or sending it to the owner’s hand), no damage is dealt by the effect of &quot;Magic Cylinder&quot;.</li>

If your opponent activates a card where discarding is part of the effect of the card, such as &quot;Card Destruction&quot;, and you chain &quot;Magical Thorn&quot;, they WILL take damage because the effect of &quot;Magical Thorn&quot; will be active before the discarding effect resolves.</li>
    <li>&quot;Magical Thorn&quot; deals damage per card, so if the opponent activates &quot;Graceful Charity&quot; they will take 1000 points of damage when they discard 2 cards. If they discard 5 cards to activate &quot;Final Destiny&quot; they take 2500 points of damage.</li>
    <li>Even though &quot;Magical Thorn&quot; does damage per card discarded, it deals the damage as one lump sum for effects like &quot;Dark Room of Nightmare&quot;.</li>
    <li>&quot;Necrovalley&quot; does not negate the effect of &quot;Magical Thorn&quot;.</li>
    <li>The effect of &quot;Magical Thorn&quot; inflicts damage after an effect resolves. So if the effect of &quot;Morphing Jar&quot; is activated, the damage will be dealt after the new cards are drawn. This means if your opponent has 100 Life Points, and you have &quot;Magical Thorn&quot; active on the field but only one card left in your Deck, you will lose the Duel before the effect of &quot;Magical Thorn&quot; can deal damage to reduce your opponent’s Life Points to 0.</li>
    <li>&quot;Magical Thorn&quot; will deal damage between steps in a chain. For example, both you and your opponent have 100 Life Points remaining, your opponent has two cards in their hand and you have &quot;Magical Thorn&quot; active on the field and a Set &quot;Mind Crush&quot;. It is your opponent’s turn and they activate &quot;Final Flame&quot; to deal 600 points of damage to you, and you chain &quot;Mind Crush&quot; calling the &quot;Sinister Serpent&quot; you know they have in their hand. After Step 2 (&quot;Mind Crush&quot;) resolves, the effect of &quot;Magical Thorn&quot; deals 500 points of damage to your opponent and you win the Duel before Step 1, &quot;Final Flame&quot;, resolves.</li>

  <p>Individual Card FAQs:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>The effect of &quot;Maiden of the Aqua&quot; is active only when there is no face-up Field Spell Card on the field. When a Field Spell Card is activated after &quot;Maiden of the Aqua&quot; is Summoned, the effect of &quot;Maiden of the Aqua&quot; is negated as long as there is a face-up Field Spell Card. If the only Field Spell Card is face-down, the effect of &quot;Maiden of the Aqua&quot; is active. If there is a face-up Field Spell Card but it is negated by &quot;Imperial Order&quot;, the effect of &quot;Maiden of the Aqua&quot; is not active.</li>
    <li>If a Field Spell Card is already active, and &quot;Maiden of the Aqua&quot; is Summoned, the existing Field Spell Card continues to function and &quot;Maiden of the Aqua&quot;’s effect is not applied until there is no face-up Field Spell Card.</li>
    <li>While &quot;Maiden of the Aqua&quot; is making the field &quot;Umi&quot;, you can activate &quot;Tornado Wall&quot; but if &quot;Maiden of the Aqua&quot; is destroyed, &quot;Tornado Wall&quot; is also destroyed.</li>
    <li>If &quot;Maiden of the Aqua&quot;, &quot;Umi&quot;, and &quot;Tornado Wall&quot; are all on your side of the field, and &quot;Umi&quot; is destroyed, &quot;Tornado Wall&quot; is not destroyed because &quot;Maiden of the Aqua&quot; treats the field as &quot;Umi&quot; as soon as &quot;Umi&quot; leaves play.</li>
    <li>If you have &quot;Maiden of the Aqua&quot; (with her effect active) and &quot;The Legendary Fisherman&quot; or &quot;Deepsea Warrior&quot; on your side of the field, and &quot;Dark Hole&quot; is activated, &quot;The Legendary Fisherman&quot; and &quot;Deepsea Warrior&quot; will not be destroyed.</li>
    <li>If you have &quot;Maiden of the Aqua&quot; and &quot;Tornado Wall&quot; on the field, and &quot;Maiden of the Aqua&quot; is attacked by &quot;Dark Driceratops&quot; and Battle Damage would be inflicted, &quot;Tornado Wall&quot; still prevents the damage during damage calculation, as &quot;Maiden of the Aqua&quot; will remain on the field until the end of the Damage Step.</li>

    <li>You may equip &quot;Megamorph&quot; to your opponent’s monster, but ‘your Life Points’ refers to the controller of &quot;Megamorph&quot;. So if you have more Life Points than your opponent, your opponent’s monster equipped with &quot;Megamorph&quot; has its ATK halved.</li>

  <p>Individual Card FAQs:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>You must remove from play at least 1 Rock-Type monster in your Graveyard in order to Special Summon “Megarock Dragon”.</li>
    <li>The original ATK of “Megarock Dragon” is determined by its effect. This is further doubled/halved by “Megamorph” and other effects that are based off of original ATK. So if you Special Summon “Megarock Dragon” with an original ATK of 2100 points, then equip it with “Megamorph”, its ATK will be 4200 or 1050 depending on your Life Points.</li>
    <li>If “Skill Drain” is active while “Megarock Dragon” is in play, the effect of “Megarock Dragon” is negated and its original ATK and DEF are treated as zero. Even if “Skill Drain” is destroyed later, the original ATK and DEF of “Megarock Dragon” will remain zero.</li>
    <li>If “Megarock Dragon” is flipped face-down, or removed from play, or sent to the Graveyard, its effect is wiped and its original ATK and DEF are zero.</li>

If your Draw Phase was skipped for some reason, you can still activate &quot;Mystical Space Typhoon&quot; to destroy &quot;Mirage of Nightmare&quot; before activating the effect of &quot;Mirage of Nightmare&quot; that will force you to discard. (You can activate any number of effects during your own Standby Phase in any order you wish, as long as required effects are dealt with by the time you leave the Standby Phase and enter your Main Phase 1.)</li>
    <li>When the turn player controls &quot;Mirage of Nightmare&quot; and &quot;Imperial Order&quot;: If you draw for &quot;Mirage of Nightmare&quot; during your opponent’s Standby Phase, and then activate &quot;Imperial Order&quot; after that, during your Standby Phase you will have 2 mandatory effects: discarding for &quot;Mirage of Nightmare&quot; and paying 700 Life Points for &quot;Imperial Order&quot; or else destroying it. In this case, you choose which effect to resolve first, and you can choose to resolve &quot;Mirage of Nightmare&quot; first, even though its effect will be negated by &quot;Imperial Order&quot;. So you activate its effect, and do not discard. Then you can choose not to pay 700 Life Points to keep &quot;Imperial Order&quot;, and &quot;Imperial Order&quot; will be destroyed.

The turn player has priority to resolve an effect first. If the turn player passes, priority goes to the opponent. If the opponent also passes, then the turn player must resolve an effect, and must pay for &quot;Imperial Order&quot; or it is destroyed.

    <li>If Player A controls Mirage of Nightmare, and Player B controls Imperial Order, and it is Player B&#39;s Standby Phase, Player B has priority and may choose to resolve an effect first.

  <h4 id='mirror-walla-idmirror-walla'>MIRROR WALL<a id="MIRROR WALL"></a></h4>
  <p>Individual Card FAQs:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>If &quot;Mirror Wall&quot; is already face-up on the field when a monster declares an attack, &quot;Mirror Wall&quot; reduces the ATK of the attacking monster by half when the attack is declared.</li>
    <li>If &quot;Mirror Wall&quot; is activated during an attack (including during the Damage Step), then it reduces the ATK of the attacking monster when &quot;Mirror Wall&quot; resolves. (Even though &quot;Mirror Wall&quot; normally reduces the attack by half when the attack is declared, it will still reduce the attack by half if you activate it after the attack is declared.)</li>
    <li>If &quot;Mirror Wall&quot; halves the ATK of a monster, it remains halved as long as &quot;Mirror Wall&quot; remains face-up on the field. If &quot;Mirror Wall&quot; is removed from the field, the ATK of the monsters is restored.</li>
    <li>If a monster attacks twice (over 2 turns, or if “Black Luster Soldier – Envoy of the Beginning” attacks twice in a row, etc.), its ATK is still only reduced by half once. So “Black Luster Soldier – Envoy of the Beginning” will have 1500 ATK for both of its attacks, for example.</li>
    <li>If you have 2 copies of &quot;Mirror Wall&quot;, and a monster attacks, its ATK is one-quarter. So “Blue-Eyes White Dragon” would have 750 ATK, for example. If 1 of the &quot;Mirror Wall&quot; copies leaves play, then the ATK is increased to half (if both copies leave play, the ATK is restored to full.)</li>
    <li>You can activate &quot;Mirror Wall&quot; during the Damage Step before damage calculation.</li>
    <li>The effect of &quot;Mirror Wall&quot; does not target.</li>
    <li>&quot;Reverse Trap&quot; will have no effect on &quot;Mirror Wall&quot;.</li>

    A: A game penalty would be in order should more than one &quot;Fiber Jar&quot; be in someone&#39;s deck. Of course, this should have already been resolved by a deck check prior to the tournament. To answer your question more generally, however, &quot;Nobleman of Crossout&quot; would allow for an opponent to check your deck to ensure compliance to the resolution of the effect. bishop, 01/23/2004</li>

  <ul>
    <li>Your opponent may indeed ask that you prove there are no more of that card in your deck. It is their right to do so. The ruling is in place in order to allow the opponent the opportunity to verify that you do not have a 2nd or 3rd copy... Unfortunately, the ruling opens the door, that the opponent gets a chance to look at your deck. Now, you do NOT give your deck to your opponent, but you may fan through it to verify that there is not another card of that name in it. The opponent may NOT take the time to stop and read card effects, look at other cards, or use this as a stalling technique themselves. This almost comes down to a courtesy that if you don&#39;t look at mine, I won&#39;t look at yours, or if you look at mine, I will look at yours.

  <p>Individual Card FAQs:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>&quot;Obnoxious Celtic Guard&quot; and &quot;Celtic Guardian&quot; are considered 2 separate monsters so you can have 3 of each in your Deck.</li>
    <li>&quot;Obnoxious Celtic Guard&quot;’s effect looks at the ATK during Damage Calculation. So if he’s WIND and is attacked by &quot;Insect Soldiers of the Sky&quot;, their ATK is 2000 during Damage Calculation and &quot;Obnoxious Celtic Guard&quot; is not destroyed. Or if an 1800 monster attacks and you use &quot;Rush Recklessly&quot; to increase the ATK to 2500 during the Damage Step, &quot;Obnoxious Celtic Guardian&quot; is not destroyed.</li>
    <li>&quot;Obnoxious Celtic Guard&quot;’s effect looks at current ATK, not original ATK. So a monster with 1000 original ATK equipped with &quot;Megamorph&quot; to make it 2000 ATK will not destroy &quot;Obnoxious Celtic Guard&quot; as a result of battle.</li>
    <li>&quot;Obnoxious Celtic Guard&quot; isn’t destroyed by damage calculation but can be destroyed by monster effects like &quot;Ryu Kokki&quot;.</li>
    <li>If &quot;Obnoxious Celtic Guard&quot; is attacked by &quot;Dark Ruler Ha Des&quot;, or another monster that negates a card’s effect after it destroys it, &quot;Obnoxious Celtic Guard&quot; is not destroyed (so its effect is not negated).</li>
    <li>&quot;Obnoxious Celtic Guard&quot;’s effect works for a battle caused by &quot;Last Turn&quot;, so if it battles a monster with ATK 1900 or higher, neither is destroyed and the Duel is a draw.</li>

  <ul>
    <li>Q: Can you chain “Ojama Trio” to the activation of a Spell or Trap Card that would Special Summon a monster in order to fill your opponents Monster Card Zone and prevent the Special Summon of the monster?<br>
    A: If there is no open Monster Zone spaces during the resolution of the card that will Special Summon the monster, the monster is destroyed. In some cases like &quot;Polymerization,&quot; one of the monsters on your opponent&#39;s side of the field may be used in the Fusion and would then leave an open space. Your opponent performing a Ritual Summon might offer a monster on their side of the field as a Tribute and would then have an open Monster Zone space to Special Summon the Ritual Monster. (They might even use your “Ojama Tokens” to help pay for the Ritual, since this Tribute would not be for a Tribute Summon) It can be situational. Curtis Schultz, 01/13/2004</li>

  <p>Individual Card FAQs:</p>
  <p>Missing the Timing: “Peten the Dark Clown” is a “when… you can” optional Trigger Effect. This means that “Peten” being sent to the Graveyard has to be the very last thing that happened in order to activate its effect.</p>
  <p>If “Peten the Dark Clown” is Tributed for a Tribute Summon, the last thing that happened was that a monster was Summoned, so the effect of “Peten” does not activate.</p>
  <p>If “Peten the Dark Clown” is Tributed for “Mystik Wok” or “Cannon Soldier”, the last thing that happened was that those effects resolved, so the effect of “Peten” does not activate.</p>
  <p>If “Peten the Dark Clown” is destroyed in a chain and not as Chain Link 1, his effect does not activate. (Example: “Pot of Greed” is activated and “Ring of Destruction” is chained, targeting “Peten”.)</p>
  <p>If “Peten the Dark Clown” is destroyed by “Cyber Jar”, the last thing that happened was that monsters were Summoned to the field, so the effect of “Peten” does not activate.</p>
  <p>If “Peten the Dark Clown” is discarded as a cost for “Tribe-Infecting Virus” or “Raigeki Break”, the last thing that happened was that those effects resolved, so the effect of “Peten” does not activate.</p>
  <p>If “Peten the Dark Clown” is discarded because of “Morphing Jar” or “Card Destruction”, the last thing that happened was that both players drew cards. So the effect of “Peten” does not activate.</p>
  <p>If “Peten the Dark Clown” is sent to the Graveyard as a result of battle, or by “Painful Choice”, the last thing that happened WAS that “Peten” was sent to the Graveyard, so his effect will activate.</p>

  <p>You cannot select the &quot;Pharaoh’s Treasure&quot; you just drew and sent to the Graveyard as the card to place in your hand.</p>
  <p>You can select a face-up &quot;Pharaoh’s Treasure&quot; in your deck as 1 of the 5 cards for &quot;Painful Choice&quot;, but because &quot;Painful Choice&quot; is not a draw, the effect of &quot;Pharaoh’s Treasure&quot; will not be activated.</p>
  <p>If you take &quot;Pharaoh’s Treasure&quot; from your opponent’s hand with &quot;Exchange&quot; and activate it, the card goes in your Deck, not the original owner’s Deck. When you draw your opponent’s &quot;Pharaoh’s Treasure&quot; from your Deck after that, the controller gets the effect of &quot;Pharaoh’s Treasure&quot; and retrieves a card from his Graveyard, but &quot;Pharaoh’s Treasure&quot; goes to the owner’s Graveyard.</p>
  <p>If &quot;Convulsion of Nature&quot; is active, place &quot;Pharaoh’s Treasure&quot; face-down so that it is the opposite direction of the rest of the cards.</p>
  <p>If a face-up &quot;Pharaoh’s Treasure&quot; is in your deck and &quot;Fiber Jar&quot; is activated, shuffle the Deck with &quot;Pharaoh’s Treasure&quot; in it; if you draw the &quot;Pharaoh’s Treasure&quot; in your new 5-card hand, the effect is activated but because there are no cards in the Graveyard to retrieve, its effect disappears.</p>
  <p>If you pick up a face-up &quot;Pharaoh’s Treasure&quot; because of &quot;Cyber Jar&quot;, this is not drawing so the effect is not activated; you may Set the &quot;Pharaoh’s Treasure&quot; you picked up and activate it again (placing it back into your Deck, etc.).</p>
  <p>You cannot activate &quot;Seven Tools of the Bandit&quot; or &quot;Solemn Judgment&quot; when &quot;Pharaoh’s Treasure&quot; is drawn.</p>
  <p>You can select a face-up &quot;Pharaoh’s Treasure&quot; from your Deck for &quot;Different Dimension Capsule&quot;; the &quot;Pharaoh’s Treasure&quot; is removed from play and kept face-down until the time elapses, at which point it is added to your hand, but it was not drawn so its effect does not activate.</p>
  <p>You can select a face-up &quot;Pharaoh’s Treasure&quot; from your deck with &quot;Cat of Ill Omen&quot;; if &quot;Necrovalley&quot; is not on the field, the &quot;Pharaoh’s Treasure&quot; is placed face-up on top of your Deck and will activate its effect when drawn.</p>
  <p>If you have no vacant Spell and Trap Zone spaces when you draw &quot;Pharaoh’s Treasure&quot;, you still get the effect of &quot;Pharaoh’s Treasure&quot; because you don’t have to put it on the field.</p>

  <p>If &quot;Drop Off&quot; is used when a face-up &quot;Pharaoh’s Treasure&quot; is drawn, &quot;Pharaoh’s Treasure&quot; is discarded and its effect disappears.</p>
  <p>If you draw a face-up &quot;Pharaoh’s Treasure&quot; with &quot;Graceful Charity&quot;, you miss the timing for the effect of &quot;Pharaoh’s Treasure&quot; and the effect disappears. &quot;Pharaoh’s Treasure&quot; is simply added to your hand. In order to apply the effect of &quot;Pharaoh’s Treasure&quot;, the very last action must have been to draw. You CAN apply Pharaoh’s Treasure’s effect if it is drawn while face-up due to &quot;Pot of Greed&quot;, &quot;Fiber Jar&quot;, etc.</p>
  <p>If &quot;Pharaoh&#39;s Treasure&quot; is drawn from your Deck (face-up) while &quot;Banisher of the Light&quot; is in play, &quot;Pharaoh&#39;s Treasure&quot; is removed from play and its effect does not activate.</p>
  <p>You select the card in your Graveyard that you wish to add to your hand when &quot;Pharaoh&#39;s Treasure&quot; is drawn and activates it effect, so your opponent can chain AFTER you have announced which card you wish to retrieve.</p>
  <p>Netrep Rulings:</p>
  <p>If “Pharaoh’s Treasure” is drawn and a discard action occurs immediately following (such as through “Graceful Charity”), the effect of “Pharaoh’s Treasure” disappears.</p>
  <p>If a face up “Pharaoh’s Treasure” is revealed, but not drawn, the effect of “Pharaoh’s Treasure” disappears.</p>
  <p>If “Drop Off” is chained to the effect of a face up “Pharaoh’s Treasure,” the effect of “Pharaoh’s Treasure” will disappear.</p>
  <p>If “Pharaoh’s Treasure” is face up in a player’s deck when the effect of “Fiber Jar” resolves, that “Pharaoh’s Treasure” will remain face up in that player’s deck. If “Pharaoh’s Treasure” is drawn as a result of “Fiber Jar’s” effect, “Pharaoh’s Treasure” will be sent to the Graveyard, but because there are no other cards, the effect of “Pharaoh’s Treasure” will disappear.</p>
  <p>An active “Jinzo” on the field will not prevent the resolution of a face up “Pharaoh’s Treasure.”</p>

  <h4 id='phoenix-wing-wind-blasta-idphoenix-wing-wind-blasta'>PHOENIX WING WIND BLAST<a id="PHOENIX WING WIND BLAST"></a></h4>
  <p>Individual Card FAQs:</p>
  <p>You cannot target a face-up non-Continuous, non-Equip Spell or Trap Card. This is because they are already “considered to be destroyed” once they are activated (even though they are not sent to the Graveyard until the chain resolves). If you target a face-down Spell or Trap Card, the opponent can activate it as a chain. If it is not Continuous, it will not be returned to the top of the Deck. It will be placed in the Graveyard after the chain resolves, as normal.</p>
  <p>You can activate “Phoenix Wing Wind Blast” and target a face-up “Swords of Revealing Light” because it destroys itself by its own effect, instead of being destroyed when activated, like most Normal Spell Cards.</p>

  <p>Individual Card FAQs:</p>

  <p>If you activate &quot;Physical Double&quot; and your opponent chains &quot;Ring of Destruction&quot; to destroy his targeted monster, the effect of &quot;Physical Double&quot; disappears.</p>
  <p>You can target a Monster Token with &quot;Physical Double&quot; to create a Mirage Token copy of it.</p>
  <p>When the targeted monster&#39;s Level, Attribute, etc. are changed after &quot;Physical Double&quot; resolves, the stats of the Mirage Token are not changed. When the targeted monster&#39;s Level, Attribute, etc., are changed before &quot;Physical Double&quot; resolves, the changed stats are adopted by the Mirage Token.</p>
  <p>If a Field Spell Card was active before resolution of &quot;Physical Double&quot; that applied to the targeted monster, it applies to the original monster and to the Mirage Token. So if a Field Spell Card was increasing ATK by +500, the original would get +500 ATK and the Mirage Token would get an additional +500 ATK, for a +1000 ATK bonus total for the Mirage Token over the printed ATK of the original monster. Likewise, when &quot;A Legendary Ocean&quot; is active, and you activate &quot;Physical Double&quot; targeting a WATER monster, the Mirage Token&#39;s Level Stars are 2 fewer than the printed Level Stars of the original targeted monster.</p>

  <p>Missing the Timing: Because the effect of &quot;Pinch Hopper&quot; effect is an optional “when… you can” Trigger Effect, &quot;Pinch Hopper&quot; being sent to the Graveyard has to be the very last thing that happened in order for you to activate its effect. So if you Tribute &quot;Pinch Hopper&quot; for a Tribute Summon, you cannot activate the effect of “Pinch Hopper” because the last thing to happen will be the Summoning of the Tribute monster. Also, if you Tribute “Pinch Hopper” for “Cannon Soldier”, the very last thing that happened will be the 500 points of damage inflicted to your opponent, so the effect of “Pinch Hopper” will not activate.</p>
  <p>If you offer &quot;Pinch Hopper&quot; as a Tribute to attack with &quot;Insect Queen&quot;, you can resolve &quot;Pinch Hopper&quot;&#39;s effect after attack declaration.</p>

  <p>Individual Card FAQs:</p>
  <p>The second effect of &quot;Pole Position&quot; does not begin a chain. When &quot;Pole Position&quot; is removed from the field, the effect is applied immediately and the monster is destroyed.</p>
  <p>If &quot;Pole Position&quot; is active, and your opponent controls &quot;Blue-Eyes White Dragon&quot; and &quot;Skull Servant&quot;, and you activate &quot;Smashing Ground&quot;, &quot;Blue-Eyes White Dragon&quot; is unaffected by Spell Cards, so the effect of &quot;Smashing Ground&quot; disappears.</p>
  <p>If you control &quot;Dark Magician&quot; and your opponent controls &quot;Blue-Eyes White Dragon&quot;, and you activate &quot;Flint&quot; targeting &quot;Blue-Eyes White Dragon&quot;, and your opponent chains &quot;Pole Position&quot;, then &quot;Flint&quot; is equipped meaninglessly to &quot;Blue-Eyes White Dragon&quot;. If &quot;Blue-Eyes White Dragon&quot; is destroyed, &quot;Flint&quot; can be equipped to &quot;Dark Magician&quot; meaninglessly if you choose (even if other monsters are on the field).</p>
  <p>If &quot;Level Limit - Area B&quot; and &quot;Pole Position&quot; are on the field, the highest ATK monster is unaffected by &quot;Level Limit - Area B&quot;. If it attacks, and during damage calculation &quot;Mask of Weakness&quot; is activated to reduce its ATK so that it is no longer the highest ATK monster on the field, the effect of &quot;Level Limit - Area B&quot; is applied. Also, the attack stops. Do not perform damage calculation.</p>
  <p>You cannot choose to Summon a monster, Set a monster, or Set or activate a Spell or Trap Card, or card effect, if it would cause an infinite loop. If you do this by mistake, just rewind the game to before the Summon/Set/activation occurred.</p>
  <p>EXAMPLE #1: I have &quot;Pole Position&quot;, &quot;Luminous Spark&quot; (+500 to LIGHT), and &quot;Gemini Elf&quot; (1900 ATK / EARTH) face-up on the field. “Gemini Elf” is the monster on the field with the highest ATK, so it is unaffected by Spell Cards. If the opponent Summons &quot;X-Head Cannon&quot; (1800 ATK / LIGHT), “Luminous Spark” will raise the ATK of “X-Head Cannon” to 2300, making it the highest ATK monster on the field, so it’s unaffected by Spell Cards, so it drops to 1800 ATK, then increases to 2300, then drops to 1800, etc. This would create an infinite loop. Therefore, the opponent cannot Summon “X-Head Cannon”. </p>
  <p>EXAMPLE #2: The opponent has &quot;Blue-Eyes White Dragon&quot; (3000 ATK) and “Pole Position” face-up on the field. I have &quot;Gemini Elf&quot; (1900 ATK), and an &quot;Opticlops&quot; (1800 ATK) equipped with &quot;Axe of Despair&quot;(+1000 ATK; 2800 total) face-up on the field, and a Set &quot;Ring of Destruction&quot;. If I activate &quot;Ring of Destruction&quot; to destroy &quot;Blue-Eyes White Dragon&quot;, then “Opticlops” will be the highest ATK monster on the field, and cause an infinite loop (it is the highest, it isn’t, it is, it isn’t, etc.). Therefore, I cannot target “Blue-Eyes White Dragon” with “Ring of Destruction”. </p>
  <p>EXAMPLE #3: The opponent has a face-down &quot;Pole Position&quot;. I have &quot;Opticlops&quot; (1800 ATK) and &quot;Gemini Elf&quot; (1900 ATK) face-up on the field. I activate &quot;Axe of Despair&quot; (+1000 ATK) and try to equip my &quot;Opticlops&quot; (1800 ATK). The opponent cannot chain &quot;Pole Position&quot;, since that would cause an infinite loop. “Pole Position” is an illegal activation. Put it back face-down. </p>
  <p>EXAMPLE #4: I have &quot;Pole Position&quot;, &quot;Blade Knight&quot; (1600 ATK / LIGHT), and &quot;Luminous Spark&quot; (+500 ATK to LIGHT) face-up on the field and 2 cards in my hand. The opponent has &quot;Giant Orc&quot; (2200 ATK / EARTH) face-up on the field, which is the highest-ATK monster on the field. If I Set 1 of the 2 cards in my hand, “Blade Knight” gains +400 ATK with its effect, becomes the highest-ATK monster, and because of “Luminous Spark” an infinite loop is created. So I am not allowed to Set a card. </p>
  <p>If an infinite loop is caused because of game mechanics and not by a player’s voluntary card play, “Pole Position” will be destroyed. When “Pole Position” is destroyed in this way, no monster on the field is destroyed by the effect of &quot;Pole Position&quot;.</p>
  <p>EXAMPLE #5: I have &quot;Pole Position&quot; and &quot;Opticlops&quot; (1800 ATK) face-up on the field. The opponent has a &quot;Muka Muka&quot; equipped with &quot;Axe of Despair&quot; face-up on the field with no cards in his hand. At the start of the opponent&#39;s turn, he draws a card, making &quot;Muka Muka&quot;s ATK 1900. An infinite loop is created by something that could not be avoided, so “Pole Position” is destroyed.</p>
  <p>EXAMPLE #6: The opponent has “Blade Knight” (1600 ATK) equipped with “Butterfly Dagger - Elma” (+300 ATK; 1900 ATK total) and 2 cards in hand, along with “Marauding Captain” (1200 ATK). The turn player has “Robbin’ Goblin”, “Pole Position”, and “Giant Orc” (2200 ATK). The turn player attacks “Marauding Captain” with “Giant Orc”, inflicting 1000 points of damage. The opponent has to discard a card because of “Robbin’ Goblin” and an infinite loop is created because “Blade Knight” now fluctuates between 2300 and 2000 ATK (either above or below “Giant Orc”, making it the strongest monster on the field… or not). Therefore, “Pole Position” is destroyed.</p>
  <p>EXAMPLE #7: I have &quot;Pole Position&quot;, &quot;Banner of Courage&quot;, and &quot;Opticlops&quot; face-up on the field. The opponent has &quot;Gemini Elf&quot; face-up on the field. When I enter my Battle Phase, an infinite loop is created as “Opticlops” fluctuates between 1800 and 2000 ATK. So “Pole Position” is destroyed.</p>
  <p>EXAMPLE #8: I have &quot;Pole Position&quot;, &quot;Gemini Elf&quot; (1900 ATK / EARTH) and &quot;Mystic Plasma Zone&quot; (+500 ATK to DARK) face-up on the field, and an &quot;Opticlops&quot; (1800 ATK / DARK) in face-down Defense Position. The opponent attacks my face-down &quot;Opticlops&quot; with &quot;Mokey Mokey&quot;. When we flip &quot;Opticlops&quot; face-up in the Damage Step, an infinite loop is created as “Opticlops” fluctuates between 1800 and 2300 ATK (either above or below “Gemini Elf”, making it the strongest monster on the field, or not). Therefore, “Pole Position” is destroyed.</p>

  <p>Individual Card FAQs:</p>
  <p>The ATK bonus for “Power Bond” lasts as long as the Fusion Monster is face-up on the field. If it is flipped face-down or removed from the field, the ATK increase disappears.</p>
  <p>The ATK bonus for “Power Bond” is not a fixed number. It is a bonus equal to the original ATK. So if the original ATK changes, so does the bonus from “Power Bond”. For example, if you equip the Fusion Monster with “Megamorph” to change the original ATK, the bonus ATK for “Power Bond” adjusts so that the bonus is equal to the new original ATK. For example, if you Summon “Cyber End Dragon” and then equip it with “Megamorph” while your Life Points are lower, its original ATK will become 8000, so it gains an additional 8000 ATK from “Power Bond” for 16000 ATK total.</p>
  <p>You cannot use “Barrel Behind the Door” against the damage from “Power Bond” because the damage happens much later than the activation of the “Power Bond” card.</p>
  <p>Even if the Fusion Monster is removed from the field or flipped face-down, you cannot negate the effect of “Power Bond” and the player will still take damage equal to the original ATK.</p>
  <p>The damage you take because of “Power Bond” is equal to the original ATK of the Fusion Monster at the time the monster is Special Summoned. If the Fusion Monster has its original ATK changed, this does not affect the damage inflicted by “Power Bond”.</p>
  <p>If you Fusion Summon “UFOroid Fighter” with 3000 ATK, and then later in the turn “Skill Drain” is activated, reducing its ATK to 0, you will still take 3000 points of damage during the End Phase.

  <p>You can prevent the damage from “Power Bond” with “Des Wombat”.</p>
  <p>If “Non-Spellcasting Area” is active and “Power Bond” is used to Special Summon a Fusion Monster that has no effect, the Fusion Monster will not gain the ATK bonus from “Power Bond”, but the controller will still take damage for “Power Bond” (because the player is not a non-Effect Monster Card).</p>

  <p>Netrep Q&amp;As:</p>
  <p>Q: Can the effect of “Precious Cards from Beyond” be used when summoning “Lava Golem” to the opponent’s side of the field?</p>
  <p>A: The effect of &quot;Lava Golem&quot; is not a Tribute Summon. It will not work with the effect of &quot;Precious Cards from Beyond.&quot; Tribute Summons are Normal Summons of 5+ Level Star monsters by offering Tributes. Curtis Schultz, 02/04/2004</p>

  <p>Netrep Q&amp;As:</p>
  <p>Q: If “Prohibition” has been activated and “Spirit Message ‘L’” is selected, will that prevent “Destiny Board” from completing the message?</p>
  <p>A: “Prohibition” would not stop the “Spirit Message ‘L’” from being placed onto the field by the effect of “Destiny Board.” Curtis Schultz, 04/07/2004</p>
  <p>Q: Does “Prohibition” only affect the field? (“Kuriboh”/”Thunder Dragon” never reach the field)</p>
  <p>A: “Prohibition” prevents the named card from being played. Activating the effect of “Thunder Dragon” or “Kuriboh” would be playing it. Curtis Schultz, 04/21/2004</p>
  <p>Q: If my opponent already has Set the card declared with “Prohibition,” can he activate the card?</p>
  <p>A: Yes they can. Prohibited cards that were Set on the field before “Prohibition” resolved can still be activated. Curtis Schultz, 04/22/2004</p>
  <p>Q: If my opponent plays “Monster Reborn” on the card declared with “Prohibition,” that is not considered “playing it” right?</p>

However, effects that are forcibly activated, like &quot;Morphing Jar&quot;, can be activated (but results may vary; see below).</p>
  <p>If &quot;Protector of the Sanctuary&quot; is on the field, then Flip Effects like &quot;Morphing Jar&quot; will still activate because they must activate when the monster is flipped (whether it was Flip Summoned, flipped by an attack, or flipped by &quot;Book of Taiyou&quot;, etc.).</p>
  <p>If &quot;Morphing Jar&quot;&#39;s effect activates, then both players discard their hands, but if you control &quot;Protector of the Sanctuary&quot;, your opponent does not draw a new hand.</p>

  <p>If you have &quot;Protector of the Sanctuary&quot;, your opponent can activate cards like &quot;Gamble&quot; that are random as to whether he can draw, but he cannot draw even if he wins the coin toss.</p>
  <p>You can chain &quot;Call of the Haunted&quot; to a card effect that would make your opponent draw, and if you Special Summon &quot;Protector of the Sanctuary&quot;, your opponent does not draw.</p>

  <p>A: The effect of &quot;Reflect Bounder&quot; would activate. This is because it is changed to Attack Position by the effect of &quot;Final Attack Orders&quot; after being flipped by the attack. This all occurs before damage calculation. Curtis Schultz, 02/09/2004</p>
  <p>Q: “Necrovalley” is face up on my side of the field. I attack my opponents face up “Reflect Bounder” with my “Gravekeeper’s Assailant”. I use “Gravekeeper’s Assailant’s” effect to change “Reflect Bounder” to defense mode. Now, do I take 2000 damage from “Reflect Bounder’s” effect, or since I changed it to defense mode, “Reflect Bounder” is destroyed by “Gravekeeper’s Assailant” taking no damage?</p>
  <p>A: The effect of &quot;Gravekeeper&#39;s Assailant&quot; activates when you declare the attack. This is during the Battle Step. If you target &quot;Reflect Bounder&quot; with the &quot;Gravekeeper&#39;s Assailant&#39;s&quot; effect and it resolves properly, &quot;Reflect Bounder&quot; will be shifted to Defense Position. Then you would enter the Damage Step. Since &quot;Reflect Bounder&quot; is now in Defense Position, its effect will not activate. Curtis Schultz, 03/04/2004</p>
  <p>Q: If “Reflect Bounder” is chosen to remain on the field for the effect of “Last Turn,” will it inflict damage to the other player?</p>
  <p>A: The turn player is the one who is attacking when “Last Turn” resolves. If the person that activated “Last Turn” controls a “Reflect Bounder,” the “Reflect Bounder’s” effect will activate. Curtis Schultz, 03/15/2004</p>

  <h4 id='relinquisheda-idrelinquisheda'>RELINQUISHED<a id="RELINQUISHED"></a></h4>
  <p>Individual Card FAQs:</p>
  <p>&quot;Relinquished&quot;’s effect to equip itself with a monster can only be activated during your Main Phase 1 or 2 since it is a Ignition Effect.</p>
  <p>A monster equipped to &quot;Relinquished&quot; occupies a Spell &amp; Trap Zone of the controller of &quot;Relinquished&quot;. So if you already have 5 Spell &amp; Trap Cards on the field you cannot activate the effect of &quot;Relinquished&quot;. Any Equip Spell Cards equipped to the selected monster are destroyed. &quot;Relinquished&quot; gains the ATK and DEF of the monster equipped to it, but not the effects of an Effect Monster.</p>
  <p>The selected monster is treated as a Monster Card when it is sent to the Graveyard, so the effects of &quot;Sangan&quot; or &quot;Witch of the Black Forest&quot; would activate, but the effect of &quot;Mystic Tomato&quot; would not, since it was not destroyed as a result of battle.</p>
  <p>You can not voluntarily destroy a monster equipped to &quot;Relinquished&quot; but you can use &quot;Mystical Space Typhoon&quot; or &quot;Emergency Provisions&quot; to eliminate it.</p>
  <p>&quot;Relinquished&quot; will only inflict its effect damage to your opponent if &quot;Relinquished&quot; would be destroyed as a result of battle and the equipped Monster Card is destroyed instead. When this occurs you inflict damage to your opponent equal to the Battle Damage that the controller of &quot;Relinquished&quot; received; this is the ONLY time &quot;Relinquished&quot; will deal effect damage. (If &quot;Relinquished&quot;, equipped with a 1800 ATK monster, attack a 3000 DEF Defense Position monster, &quot;Relinquished’s&quot; controller takes 1200 damage but &quot;Relinquished&quot; does not inflict effect damage to the opponent.)</p>
  <p>You can activate &quot;Barrel Behind the Door&quot; against Trigger Effects like &quot;Lava Golem&quot;, &quot;Giant Germ&quot;, &quot;Relinquished&quot; (when it inflicts effect damage, since &quot;Barrel Behind the Door&quot; can be activated during the Damage Step because it is a Counter-Trap Card), &quot;Minar&quot; (when discarded), &quot;Parasite Paracide&quot; (when it inflicts effect damage), &quot;Bowganian&quot;, &quot;Mushroom Man #2&quot;, &quot;Reflect Bounder&quot; (when it is attacked), &quot;Shinato, King of a Higher Plane&quot; (when it attacks and destroys a Defense Position monster and sends it to the Graveyard), &quot;Granadora&quot; (when destroyed and sent to the Graveyard), &quot;Balloon Lizard&quot; (when destroyed), &quot;KA-2 Des Scissors&quot;, &quot;Needle Burrower&quot;, &quot;Atomic Firefly&quot;, &quot;Elephant Statue of Disaster&quot;, and &quot;Ameba&quot;.</p>
  <p>Your opponent cannot target your &quot;Blindly Loyal Goblin&quot; with the effect of &quot;Relinquished&quot; or &quot;Thousand-Eyes Restrict&quot;.</p>
  <p>While &quot;Gorgon’s Eye&quot; is active, if &quot;Relinquished&quot; equipped with a monster is in Defense Position, the effect of &quot;Relinquished&quot; is negated, it can no longer be equipped with a monster, and the Monster Card equipped to &quot;Relinquished&quot; is destroyed and sent to the Graveyard.</p>
  <p>If your opponent takes control of your monster with &quot;Snatch Steal&quot;, etc., and you activate &quot;Relinquished&quot;&#39;s effect on your next turn to equip the monster to &quot;Relinquished&quot;, and your opponent chains &quot;Remove Brainwashing&quot; to &quot;Relinquished&quot;&#39;s effect, control of the monster returns to you before &quot;Relinquished&quot;&#39;s effect resolves and, since you cannot use &quot;Relinquished&quot;&#39;s effect on monsters on your side of the field, &quot;Relinquished&quot;&#39;s effect disappears.</p>
  <p>Monsters equipped to &quot;Relinquished&quot; while &quot;Skill Drain&quot; is active are negated and destroyed because &quot;Relinquished&quot; no longer has an effect that allows it to be equipped with a monster, and &quot;Relinquished&quot;&#39;s ATK and DEF are returned to normal.</p>
  <p>While the effect of &quot;Timidity&quot; is active, you cannot destroy a face-down Monster Card equipped to &quot;Relinquished&quot;.</p>

  <h4 id='remove-brainwashinga-idremove-brainwashinga'>REMOVE BRAINWASHING<a id="REMOVE BRAINWASHING"></a></h4>
  <p>Individual Card FAQs:</p>
  <p>When &quot;Remove Brainwashing&quot; is activated, monsters like &quot;Lava Golem&quot; &amp; &quot;Parasite Paracide&quot; will return to their owner&#39;s side of the field, monsters revived with &quot;Monster Reborn&quot; return to their owner&#39;s side of the field, monsters taken with &quot;Exchange&quot; and played normally return to their owner&#39;s side of the field, etc.</p>
  <p>When &quot;Remove Brainwashing&quot; is already active on the field and a switching effect is activated, or &quot;Remove Brainwashing&quot; is chained to a switching effect and is thus active before the switching effect resolves, control switches due to the effect but then switches back to the original owner because of &quot;Remove Brainwashing&quot;. So for &quot;Creature Swap&quot;, control is changed but then control goes back to the original owners. This means that if you give control of &quot;Griggle&quot; or &quot;Ameba&quot; to your opponent, their effect IS activated even though &quot;Griggle&quot;/&quot;Ameba&quot; then returns to the original owner&#39;s control afterwards.</p>
  <p>If &quot;Monster Reborn&quot; is activated and &quot;Remove Brainwashing&quot; is chained (or was already active on the field), the monster goes to the side of the field of the player who activated &quot;Monster Reborn&quot;, then switches back to the original owner immediately afterwards.</p>
  <p>If &quot;Remove Brainwashing&quot; is activated and a player already has 5 monsters on the field, the returning monsters are destroyed. If multiple monsters are returning to the owner due to &quot;Remove Brainwashing&quot;, and he does not have enough room for all of them, the player who controlled the monsters chooses the ones that are destroyed and the ones that return successfully.</p>
  <p>When &quot;Snatch Steal&quot; is active, the +1000 Life Points effect is applied even if &quot;Remove Brainwashing&quot; has returned control of the monster to the original owner.</p>
  <p>&quot;Remove Brainwashing&quot; has no effect on a Monster Card equipped to &quot;Relinquished&quot; or &quot;Thousand-Eyes Restrict&quot;, and the Monster Card remains where it is, because it is an Equip Spell Card.</p>
  <p>If &quot;Remove Brainwashing&quot; is destroyed, control does not revert again, so if I activate &quot;Change of Heart&quot; and my opponent chains &quot;Remove Brainwashing&quot;, control of the monster comes to me and then reverts to my opponent. Then, later in the turn, if &quot;Remove Brainwashing&quot; is destroyed with &quot;Heavy Storm&quot;, control does not revert back to me and remains with the original owner. (The same for &quot;Creature Swap&quot;, etc.)</p>
  <p>If your opponent takes control of your monster with &quot;Snatch Steal&quot;, etc., and you activate &quot;Relinquished&quot;&#39;s effect on your next turn to equip the monster to &quot;Relinquished&quot;, and your opponent chains &quot;Remove Brainwashing&quot; to &quot;Relinquished&quot;&#39;s effect, control of the monster returns to you before &quot;Relinquished&quot;&#39;s effect resolves and, since you cannot use &quot;Relinquished&quot;&#39;s effect on monsters on your side of the field, &quot;Relinquished&quot;&#39;s effect disappears.</p>
  <p>Control of &quot;Blindly Loyal Goblin&quot; cannot change even because of &quot;Remove Brainwashing&quot;, so if &quot;Blindly Loyal Goblin&quot; is Summoned due to &quot;Monster Reborn&quot; or using &quot;Exchange&quot;, the original owner will not control &quot;Blindly Loyal Goblin&quot;.</p>

  <p>Individual Card FAQs:</p>
  <p>When &quot;Rivalry of Warlords&quot; is activated, each player must send monsters to the Graveyard so that he controls only 1 Type of monster face-up. You don&#39;t select or name a Type when &quot;Rivalry of Warlords&quot; is activated; instead, you make it so you have only 1 Type. If, after this, your monsters are destroyed so you have no monsters on the field, you are free to play any Type again, and that new Type becomes the Type that you must play. (So if you send monsters to the Graveyard so you control only Spellcaster-Types, and your Spellcaster-Type monsters are destroyed, you may play a Dragon-Type monster, but can then only play Dragon-Type monsters as long as you control 1 or more face-up Dragon-Type monsters. If all your monsters are again destroyed, you can again play whatever Type you want.)</p>
  <p>This also means that when &quot;Rivalry of Warlords&quot; is active, each player can control a different face-up Type than his opponent.</p>
  <p>You can activate &quot;Rivalry of Warlords&quot; when either or both player(s) does not have any face-up monsters on the field, in which case once a player does have a face-up monster that monster&#39;s Type becomes that player&#39;s Type for purposes of &quot;Rivalry of Warlords&quot; (as long as the monster remains face-up on that player&#39;s side of the field).</p>
  <p>When &quot;Rivalry of Warlords&quot; is activated, it has no effect on monsters that are face-down at that time and does not flip those monsters face-up.</p>
  <p>While &quot;Rivalry of Warlords&quot; is active, you can still Set monsters face-down if they are a different Type than the Type you control. If your face-down monster of a different Type is attacked, then the monster is destroyed after damage calculation. If the destroyed monster of a different Type was a Flip Effect Monster, its Flip Effect is still activated, and then the destroyed monster is sent to the Graveyard. If your face-down monster of a different Type is flipped by &quot;Swords of Revealing Light&quot;, &quot;Book of Taiyou&quot;, etc., then it is destroyed as necessary.</p>
  <p>As long as &quot;Rivalry of Warlords&quot; is active, you cannot Summon, Flip Summon, or Special Summon an inappropriate Type face-up (including &quot;Jinzo&quot;), but you can Special Summon face-down with &quot;The Shallow Grave&quot;, &quot;Morphing Jar #2&quot;, etc.</p>
  <p>If you have only 1 monster on the field face-up, you may Tribute it for a monster that is a different Type.</p>
  <p>If you have 2 monsters on the field face-up of the same Type, you cannot Tribute 1 of them for another monster that is a different Type (even &quot;Jinzo&quot;) as you would then have 2 different Types.</p>
  <p>If &quot;Cyber Jar&quot; is activated while &quot;Rivalry of Warlords&quot; is active, you can Special Summon different Types of monsters face-down without penalty, or Special Summon 1 Type face-up and all the others face-down. But if you Special Summon different Types of monsters face-up, you have to destroy monsters to make it 1 Type.</p>
  <p>When &quot;Rivalry of Warlords&quot; is active, and you change the Type of all of your monsters with &quot;DNA Surgery&quot; or &quot;Parasite Paracide&quot; or &quot;D. Tribe&quot;, you now only have 1 Type so you are OK and no monsters are destroyed, and you can also Summon, Flip Summon, and Special Summon additional monsters that do not have that printed Type on the card and they will be considered that Type and are not destroyed.</p>
  <p>If you activate &quot;Magical Hats&quot; while &quot;Rivalry of Warlords&quot; is active, the cards Special Summoned with &quot;Magical Hats&quot; are unaffected by &quot;Rivalry of Warlords&quot; because they have no Type.</p>
  <p>When &quot;Rivalry of Warlords&quot; is active you can activate &quot;Dragonic Attack&quot;, but if you have other face-up monsters that are not Dragon-Types then the targeted monster is destroyed.</p>
  <p>If &quot;Rivalry of Warlords&quot; is active and you take control of your opponent&#39;s face-up monster with &quot;Change of Heart&quot; or &quot;Snatch Steal&quot;, and that monster is a different Type than your other face-up monster(s), your opponent&#39;s monster is destroyed.</p>
  <p>Netrep Rulings:</p>
  <p>If a face-down monster is turned face up and does not match the Type of the other monsters on the field while “Rivalry of Warlords” is active, that monster is destroyed after Damage Calculation.</p>

  <p>Monsters may be Set or Special Summoned face-down, even if of a different Type while “Rivalry of Warlords” is active.</p>

Since you control both effects you can choose the order that they go on a Chain, so you can have the opponent draw due to the effect of &quot;The Bistro Butcher&quot; and then discard for the effect of &quot;Robbin’ Goblin&quot;.</p>

  <h4 id='royal-oppressiona-idroyal-oppressiona'>ROYAL OPPRESSION<a id="ROYAL OPPRESSION"></a></h4>
  <p>Individual Card FAQs:</p>
  <p>There are basically 2 ways to Special Summon a monster. The first way is with a Spell Card like &quot;Monster Reborn&quot;, a Trap Card like &quot;Call of the Haunted&quot;, or an Effect Monster like &quot;Magical Scientist&quot;. The second way is built in to the monster, and Special Summons it without activating an effect, such as &quot;Black Luster Soldier - Envoy of the Beginning&quot; or &quot;Dark Necrofear&quot;. &quot;Royal Oppression&quot; can negate both of these types of Special Summon. In the first case, you chain the activation of &quot;Royal Oppression&quot;’s effect to the activation of the Spell, Trap, or Monster Card’s effect, and negate the effect. In the second case, right before the monster is Special Summoned, you can activate the effect of &quot;Royal Oppression&quot; to negate the Special Summon (the same procedure that you use for &quot;Horn of Heaven&quot; or &quot;Solemn Judgment&quot;).</p>
  <p>Example 1: If &quot;Marauding Captain&quot; is Normal Summoned, its effect activates. You can chain to this effect by activating the effect of &quot;Royal Oppression&quot;. The effect of &quot;Marauding Captain&quot; is negated, no monster is Special Summoned, and the &quot;Marauding Captain&quot; is destroyed. (The monster your opponent intended to Special Summon with the effect of &quot;Marauding Captain&quot; remains in his hand.)</p>
  <p>Example 2: If &quot;Cyber Jar&quot; is Flip Summoned and its Flip Effect activates, you can activate the effect of &quot;Royal Oppression&quot; in a chain to the Flip Effect. The effect of &quot;Cyber Jar&quot; is negated, no monsters on the field are destroyed by its effect, no cards are picked up, no monsters are Special Summoned, and &quot;Cyber Jar&quot; is destroyed by the effect of &quot;Royal Oppression&quot;.</p>
  <p>Example 3: If &quot;Call of the Haunted&quot; is activated, you can activate the effect of &quot;Royal Oppression&quot; in a chain. The effect of &quot;Call of the Haunted&quot; is negated, and a monster is not Special Summoned.</p>
  <p>The effects of face-up Trap Cards cannot be activated during the Damage Step, so this card’s effect cannot negate the Special Summoning of a monster by the effect of “Mystic Tomato” or a “Cyber Jar” flipped face-up by an attack.</p>
  <p>You can activate the effect of &quot;Royal Oppression&quot; as a chain to &quot;Monster Gate&quot;. No cards will be picked up, and no monster will be Special Summoned (The opponent still must have Tributed a monster as a cost).</p>
  <p>You can activate the effect of &quot;Royal Oppression&quot; to negate an effect that Summons 1 monster, or Summons multiple monsters (like &quot;Cyber Jar&quot;, &quot;The Shallow Grave&quot;, or &quot;Valkyrion the Magna Warrior&quot;).</p>
  <p>If &quot;Royal Oppression&quot; is face-up on the field, and &quot;Monster Reborn&quot; is activated to Special Summon &quot;Jinzo&quot;, you can activate the effect of &quot;Royal Oppression&quot; in a chain to negate the Special Summon because &quot;Jinzo&quot; is not on the field until the chain resolves.</p>
  <p>If you have &quot;Royal Oppression&quot; face-up on your side of the field, and your opponent attempts to Special Summon &quot;Dark Necrofear&quot;, and you activate the effect of your &quot;Royal Oppression&quot;, then &quot;Dark Necrofear&quot; will activate its effect in the Graveyard and return to the field as an Equip Spell Card. But if your opponent had &quot;Royal Oppression&quot; face-up on his side of the field, and you activate the effect of your opponent’s &quot;Royal Oppression&quot; to negate the Special Summon of your opponent’s &quot;Dark Necrofear&quot;, then &quot;Dark Necrofear&quot; does not activate its effect in the Graveyard, because it was destroyed by an effect controlled by its owner, not by its owner’s opponent (even though the owner did not activate the effect, he still controls the &quot;Royal Oppression&quot; card).</p>
  <p>When &quot;Vampire Lord&quot; is Special Summoned by its effect, you can activate the effect of &quot;Royal Oppression&quot; to negate the Special Summon and destroy &quot;Vampire Lord&quot;. If your &quot;Vampire Lord&quot; is destroyed in this way by the effect of a &quot;Royal Oppression&quot; card controlled by your opponent, then &quot;Vampire Lord&quot; was destroyed by a card controlled by your opponent, and is Special Summoned during your next Standby Phase.</p>
  <p>When &quot;Insect Queen&quot; destroys your opponent’s monster, an &quot;Insect Monster Token&quot; is Special Summoned during the End Phase, and the effect of &quot;Royal Oppression&quot; can be activated at that time to negate the Special Summon and destroy &quot;Insect Queen&quot;.</p>
  <p>When &quot;Jam Breeding Machine&quot; activates its effect to Special Summon a &quot;Slime Token&quot; in the Standby Phase, and the effect of &quot;Royal Oppression&quot; can be activated at that time to negate the Special Summon and destroy &quot;Jam Breeding Machine&quot;.</p>
  <p>If the effect of &quot;Royal Oppression&quot; is activated, and &quot;Mystical Space Typhoon&quot; or &quot;Dust Tornado&quot; is chained to destroy &quot;Royal Oppression&quot;, then the effect of &quot;Royal Oppression&quot; disappears because it is a Continuous Trap Card, and the Special Summon will not be negated.</p>
  <p>Remember that &quot;Royal Oppression&quot; follows the rules of all Continuous Trap Cards. In order to chain the effect of &quot;Royal Oppression&quot; to a card effect, &quot;Royal Oppression&quot; must have already been face-up on the field. For example, if &quot;Monster Reborn&quot; is activated, you cannot flip &quot;Royal Oppression&quot; face-up and activate the effect of &quot;Royal Oppression&quot; in the same chain.</p>

  <p>Individual Card FAQs:</p>
  <p>You can activate “Divine Wrath” when “Sacred Phoenix of Nephthys” is Special Summoned by its own effect. Because this effect activates in the Graveyard, and is being negated while &quot;Sacred Phoenix of Nepthys&quot; is in the Graveyard, &quot;Sacred Phoenix of Nepthys&quot; is never Special Summoned (so the card is never moved from the Graveyard) and is never destroyed. Because it is not destroyed, its effect to Special Summon itself does not activate again.</p>
  <p>If “Sacred Phoenix of Nephthys” is Special Summoned with “Call of the Haunted” or “Premature Burial”, and that card is destroyed and destroys “Sacred Phoenix of Nephthys” with its effect, you Special Summon “Sacred Phoenix of Nephthys” during your next Standby Phase because it was destroyed by a card effect.</p>
  <p>If “Sacred Phoenix of Nephthys” is destroyed while in your hand or Deck by a card effect, you still activate its effect during your next Standby Phase to Special Summon it from the Graveyard. (For example, if an effect like “Star Boy” is active, and “Sacred Phoenix of Nephthys” is Summoned, and “Chain Destruction” is activated to destroy other copies of “Sacred Phoenix of Nephthys” in the hand and Deck, those copies will be Special Summoned during your next Standby Phase.</p>
  <p>If “Skill Drain” is active on the field, the effect of “Sacred Phoenix of Nephthys” that Special Summons it from the Graveyard is still activated, because it is activated in the Graveyard. However, the effect that destroys Spell and Trap Cards on the field is negated because it activates on the field (so “Skill Drain” and other Spell and Trap Cards on the field are not destroyed in this case).</p>
  <p>If “Sacred Phoenix of Nephthys” is Summoned, and the Summon is negated by “Horn of Heaven”, it is Special Summoned during your next Standby Phase because it was destroyed by a card effect.</p>
  <p>If your opponent controls your “Sacred Phoenix of Nephthys”, and it is destroyed by a card effect, because the effect activates in the Graveyard, it is the owner that gets the effect and Special Summons “Sacred Phoenix of Nephthys” during their Standby Phase.</p>
  <p>If “Sacred Phoenix of Nephthys” is destroyed during your Draw Phase, you can Special Summon it during the Standby Phase of that same turn.</p>
  <p>If “Sacred Phoenix of Nephthys” is destroyed and removed from play, such as with “Bottomless Trap Hole”, it is not Special Summoned from out of play during the Standby Phase, because this effect activates in the Graveyard.</p>
  <p>If “Rivalry of Warlords” is active, and your opponent takes control of your “Sacred Phoenix of Nephthys” while controlling monsters that are not Winged Beast-Type, “Sacred Phoenix of Nephthys” is not considered destroyed by the effect of “Rivalry of Warlords”, but rather by a condition that made it impossible for it to exist on that side of the field. So it is not Special Summoned by its own effect during the Standby Phase.</p>
  <p>If “Sacred Phoenix of Nephthys” is destroyed while it is not a Monster Card, such as when it is equipped to “Relinquished” or “Sword Hunter”, its effect does not activate and it is not Special Summoned.</p>
  <p>You can chain to the effect of “Sacred Phoenix of Nephthys” that destroys all Spell and Trap Cards.</p>
  <p>If “Sacred Phoenix of Nephthys” is Special Summoned by its effect during the Standby Phase, and “Card of Safe Return” is on the field, “Sacred Phoenix of Nephthys” is Step 1 of the chain and “Card of Safe Return” is Step 2, so “Card of Safe Return” resolves first and you draw a card before “Card of Safe Return” is destroyed.</p>

  <p>If you activate &quot;Secret Barrel&quot; and your opponent activates something as a chain, the chained card is included in the number (so if your opponent&#39;s only card on the field or in his hand is &quot;Mystical Space Typhoon&quot;, and he chains &quot;Mystical Space Typhoon&quot; to &quot;Secret Barrel&quot;, he still takes 200 damage).</p>
  <p>Monster Tokens are counted for &quot;Secret Barrel&quot;.</p>

  <h4 id='secret-pass-to-the-treasuresa-idsecret-pass-to-the-treasuresa'>SECRET PASS TO THE TREASURES<a id="SECRET PASS TO THE TREASURES"></a></h4>
  <p>Individual Card FAQs:</p>
  <p>There is no way to have a monster with an ATK above 1000 attack directly using the effect of &quot;Secret Pass to the Treasures&quot;. When you target a monster with &quot;Secret Pass to the Treasures&quot;, and the monster’s ATK is increased above 1000 afterwards, the monster cannot attack your opponent’s Life Points directly.</p>
  <p>If the monster attacks your opponent’s Life Points directly, you cannot use an effect such as &quot;Rush Recklessly&quot; to increase its ATK above 1000 during the attack. If a monster attacks directly using the effect of &quot;Secret Pass to the Treasures&quot;, &quot;automatic&quot; increases will not apply (&quot;Super Robolady&quot;, etc.). If you use &quot;Secret Pass to the Treasures&quot; on &quot;Injection Fairy Lily&quot;, and attack directly, you cannot activate the effect of &quot;Injection Fairy Lily&quot;.</p>
  <p>You cannot activate &quot;Secret Pass to the Treasures&quot; during Main Phase 2 or on the very first turn.</p>
  <p>This card targets a monster.</p>
  <p>Netrep Rulings:</p>
  <p>Monsters able to attack more than once in a turn may attack directly each time from the effect of “Secret Pass to the Treasures” as long as the ATK of the monster does not rise above 1000.</p>

  <h4 id='self-destruct-buttona-idself-destruct-buttona'>SELF-DESTRUCT BUTTON<a id="SELF-DESTRUCT BUTTON"></a></h4>
  <p>Individual Card FAQs:</p>
  <p>If you activate &quot;Self-Destruction Button&quot;, and an effect is chained so that the different in Life Points is less than 7000, &quot;Self-Destruction Button&quot; still resolves because its conditions were correct at the time of activation.</p>
  <br>
  <h4 id='senri-eyea-idsenri-eyea'>SENRI EYE<a id="SENRI EYE"></a></h4>
  <p>Individual Card FAQs:</p>
  <p>You cannot use &quot;Senri Eye&quot;&#39;s effect more than once during the same Standby Phase.</p>
  <p>You can use the effect of &quot;Senri Eye&quot; if the top card on the Deck is face-up (due to &quot;Convulsion of Nature&quot; or &quot;Parasite Paracide&quot;), and in that case you don&#39;t hide the card from your opponent.</p>
  <br>
  <h4 id='serial-spella-idserial-spella'>SERIAL SPELL<a id="SERIAL SPELL"></a></h4>
  <p>Individual Card FAQs:</p>
  <p>&quot;Serial Spell&quot; must be chained to the activation of your Normal Spell Card. Nothing can be chained in-between by yourself or your opponent. If your opponent chains to your Normal Spell Card, you cannot chain &quot;Serial Spell&quot; to that Normal Spell Card. Because of this, it is impossible to chain 2 copies of &quot;Serial Spell&quot; to the same Normal Spell Card.</p>
  <p>&quot;Serial Spell&quot; does not target a card.</p>
  <p>If you chain &quot;Serial Spell&quot; to a Normal Spell Card that targets a card(s) you can select a different target(s) for the &quot;Serial Spell&quot; copy of the Normal Spell Card.</p>
  <p>Discarding your hand is a cost to activate &quot;Serial Spell&quot;. You cannot activate &quot;Serial Spell&quot; if it is the only card in your hand, or if it is Set and you have no cards in your hand.</p>
  <p>&quot;Serial Spell&quot; only copies the effects of your Normal Spell Card, not any costs of that Spell Card. So if you chain &quot;Serial Spell&quot; to &quot;Delinquent Duo&quot; you do not pay an additional 1000 Life Points.</p>
  <p>If you activate &quot;Monster Reborn&quot;, and chain &quot;Serial Spell&quot;, discarding your entire hand, you can select and revive one of the monsters you discarded for the cost of &quot;Serial Spell&quot; to be the monster that &quot;Serial Spell&quot; Special Summons to the field. (For example, if you target &quot;Dark Magician&quot; with &quot;Monster Reborn&quot;, then chain &quot;Serial Spell&quot; and discard &quot;Buster Blader&quot;, you can use &quot;Serial Spell&quot; to Special Summon the &quot;Buster Blader&quot; you discarded to activate &quot;Serial Spell&quot;.)</p>
  <p>You cannot level up &quot;Horus the Black Flame Dragon&quot; from 4 to 8 with just &quot;Level Up!&quot; and &quot;Serial Spell&quot;. Because you would send &quot;LV4&quot; to the Graveyard for &quot;Level Up!&quot;, but even if you copy it with &quot;Serial Spell&quot;, the first &quot;Level Up!&quot; hasn&#39;t resolved, so &quot;LV6&quot; isn&#39;t on the field to send to the Graveyard as a cost for the copy of &quot;Level Up!&quot; If you have &quot;Horus the Black Flame Dragon LV4&quot; and &quot;Armed Dragon LV3&quot; on the field, and send one of them to the Graveyard with &quot;Level Up!&quot;, you cannot use &quot;Serial Spell&quot; to Level Up the other monster, since there was no monster sent to the Graveyard as a cost for &quot;Serial Spell&quot;, and &quot;Serial Spell&quot; would have no point of reference to resolve its effect.</p>
  <p>If you chain &quot;Serial Spell&quot; to &quot;Swords of Revealing Light&quot; it will copy the effect of flipping all monsters face-up, but it will not remain on the field and prevent the opponent from attacking. This is because it is a Quick-Play Spell Card and is sent to the Graveyard after the chain resolves.</p>
  <p>If you chain &quot;Serial Spell&quot; to &quot;Different Dimension Capsule&quot; it will copy the effect and remove 1 card you select in your Deck from play, face-down. But because &quot;Serial Spell&quot; does not remain on the field, the selected card remains removed from play face-down and is not placed in your hand.</p>
  <p>You can activate &quot;Serial Spell&quot; to copy the effect of a Normal Spell Card, even if it is &quot;Raigeki&quot; or &quot;Soul Exchange&quot; and copying the effect serves no real purpose.</p>
  <p>If you have 2 monsters in your Graveyard, and your opponent only has 1 monster in their Graveyard, you can activate &quot;The Shallow Grave&quot; and chain &quot;Serial Spell&quot;, even though you would not normally be able to activate a second &quot;The Shallow Grave&quot; because your monster would no longer have any monsters in the Graveyard. As a result, you will Special Summon 2 monsters and your opponent will only Special Summon 1 monster.</p>
  <p>If you chain &quot;Serial Spell&quot; to &quot;Bait Doll&quot;, the entire effect of &quot;Bait Doll&quot; is applied and &quot;Serial Spell&quot; is also shuffled back into your Deck.</p>
  <p>If you chain &quot;Serial Spell&quot; to &quot;Dragged Down into the Grave&quot;, the player who activated &quot;Serial Spell&quot; has no cards in hand, so the effect of &quot;Dragged Down into the Grave&quot; is impossible to resolve, and the effect disappears.</p>
  <p>If you chain &quot;Serial Spell&quot; to &quot;Metamorphosis&quot;, there is no effect because you did not Tribute a monster for a cost, so &quot;Serial Spell&quot; has no point of reference and cannot resolve.</p>
  <p>If you chain &quot;Serial Spell&quot; to &quot;Monster Gate&quot; resolve the effect of &quot;Monster Gate&quot; twice (once for &quot;Serial Spell&quot; and once for &quot;Monster Gate&quot;) even though you only pay the cost once (for &quot;Monster Gate&quot;).</p>

  <p>Individual Card FAQs:</p>
  <p>When &quot;Serpentine Princess&quot; is returned to the Deck by an effect occurring in a chain, the effect of &quot;Serpentine Princess&quot; starts a new Chain after the current Chain resolves completely.</p>
  <p>If the effect of &quot;Fiber Jar&quot; places &quot;Serpentine Princess&quot; from the field into your Deck, the effect of &quot;Serpentine Princess&quot; is activated and will be applied after the effect of &quot;Fiber Jar&quot; has finished resolving.</p>

  <p>Individual Card FAQs:</p>
  <p>For &quot;Shadowslayer&quot; (unlike cards like &quot;Black Tyranno&quot; and &quot;Drillago&quot;), only the Monster Card Zones are looked at. If all of your opponent’s monsters are in Defense Position, then &quot;Shadowslayer&quot; can attack directly even if your opponent has Spell and Trap Cards on the field.</p>
  <p>If &quot;Shadowslayer&quot; attacks a face-up Attack Position monster, and the opponent activates &quot;Book of Moon&quot; so that his only monster on the field is now in Defense Position, a replay occurs, because &quot;Shadowslayer&quot; is now able to attack directly.</p>
  <p>If all of your opponent’s monsters are in Defense Position but one of them is equipped with &quot;Ring of Magnetism&quot;, &quot;Shadowslayer&quot; cannot attack directly and must attack that monster if it attacks.</p>

  <p>If you chain “Book of Moon” to “Shien’s Spy” to flip the target face-down, the monster still switches to the opponent and returns in the End Phase as normal.</p>
  <p>If a monster switches sides because of “Shien’s Spy” and is then flipped face-down, it still returns in the End Phase as normal.</p>
  <p>When a monster returns to the controller during the End Phase for the effect of “Shien’s Spy”, this is not an effect that can be chained to.</p>

  <p>If you control a monster that is targeted by your opponent&#39;s &quot;Nightmare Wheel&quot;, and you flip it face-down with &quot;Book of Moon&quot;, and control at least 1 other face-down Defense Position monster, you can activate the effect of “Shifting Shadows”.

  <p>When your &quot;Shinato, King of a Higher Plane&quot; destroys &quot;Gradius&#39; Option&quot; or &quot;Maju Garzett&quot;, your opponent takes no damage from &quot;Shinato, King of a Higher Plane&quot;&#39;s effect.</p>
  <p>If &quot;Shinato, King of a Higher Plane&quot; is destroyed before monsters are sent to the Graveyard, for example if removed from play by &quot;D. D. Warrior Lady&quot;, his effect does not activate. But if &quot;Shinato, King of a Higher Plane&quot; attacks &quot;Yomi Ship&quot;, &quot;Shinato, King of a Higher Plane&quot; inflicts the damage from his effect even though he will be destroyed by &quot;Yomi Ship&quot;&#39;s effect after &quot;Yomi Ship&quot; is sent to the Graveyard.</p>
  <p>When &quot;Shinato, King of a Higher Plane&quot; destroys a Defense Position monster, your opponent can activate &quot;Barrel Behind the Door&quot; as a chain to &quot;Shinato, King of a Higher Plane&quot;&#39;s effect.</p>
  <p>When your &quot;Shinato, King of a Higher Plane&quot; is equipped with &quot;Fairy Meteor Crush&quot; and destroys your opponent&#39;s Defense Position monster, first, during damage calculation, &quot;Shinato, King of a Higher Plane&quot; inflicts Battle Damage to your opponent&#39;s Life Points because of &quot;Fairy Meteor Crush&quot;, and then, when the Defense Position monster is sent to the Graveyard, &quot;Shinato, King of a Higher Plane&quot;&#39;s effect inflicts damage equal to the original ATK of the destroyed monster.</p>

  <p>Individual Card FAQs:</p>
  <p>&quot;Shooting Star Bow - Ceal&quot; decreases the current ATK. So if &quot;Injection Fairy Lily&quot; is equipped with &quot;Shooting Star Bow - Ceal&quot; and activates her effect, her ATK is 2400 ((400 - 1000) + 3000 = 2400).</p>

  <p>&quot;Tyrant Dragon&quot; must attack a monster in order to gain its second attack, so if it is equipped with &quot;Shooting Star Bow - Ceal&quot; and attacks directly, it cannot get a second attack. But &quot;Tyrant Dragon&quot; equipped with &quot;Shooting Star Bow - Ceal&quot; can attack a monster, and then attack directly.</p>

  <br>
  <h4 id='silent-swordsman-lv5a-idsilent-swordsman-lv5a'>SILENT SWORDSMAN LV5<a id="SILENT SWORDSMAN LV5"></a></h4>
  <p>Individual Card FAQs:</p>
  <p>Just like “The Legendary Fisherman” and other monsters that are unaffected by Spell Cards, “Silent Swordsman LV5” can attack normally if your opponent has “Swords of Revealing Light” on the field, and its controller is unaffected by effects like “Toll” and “Gravekeeper’s Servant” when “Silent Swordsman LV5” attacks.</p>
  <p>If you control “Blue-Eyes White Dragon” and “Silent Swordsman LV5”, and your opponent activates “Fissure”, the monster with the lowest ATK is “Silent Swordsman LV5”, but it is unaffected by Spell Cards, so the effect of “Fissure” disappears.</p>
  <p>“Silent Swordsman LV5” is unaffected by Spell Cards your opponent controls, including those in your opponent’s hand due to “Exchange” or “Graverobber”.</p>
  <p>You can Special Summon “Silent Swordsman LV5” with “Autonomous Action Unit”. If “Autonomous Action Unit” is removed from the field, “Silent Swordsman LV5” is unaffected and remains on the field.</p>

  <p>Individual Card FAQs:</p>
  <p>The effect of this card is optional; you do not have to return it to your hand.</p>
  <p>The effect of this card activates no matter how it is sent to the Graveyard. It can be destroyed, Tributed, discarded from the hand, or sent straight from the Deck to the Graveyard.</p>
  <p>If your &quot;Sinister Serpent&quot; is on the field and is destroyed during your Standby Phase, you may return it to your hand during that same Standby Phase.</p>
  <p>If &quot;Sinister Serpent&quot; is destroyed as a result of battle with &quot;Dark Ruler Ha Des&quot; or &quot;Dark Balter the Terrible&quot; you cannot activate its effect and return it to your hand during your next Standby Phase, or any subsequent Standby Phase.</p>
  <p>You cannot activate the effect of &quot;Sinister Serpent&quot; if &quot;The End of Anubis&quot; is on the field.</p>

  <h4 id='skill-draina-idskill-draina'>SKILL DRAIN<a id="SKILL DRAIN"></a></h4>
  <p>Individual Card FAQs:</p>
  <p>Paying 1000 Life Points is a cost.</p>
  <p>&quot;Skill Drain&quot; negates the effects of face-up Effect Monsters on the field, but does not negate effects that activate in the Graveyard, such as &quot;Witch of the Black Forest&quot;, &quot;Sangan&quot;, &quot;Mystic Tomato&quot;, &quot;Giant Rat&quot;, &quot;Exiled Force&quot;, &quot;Sinister Serpent&quot;, and &quot;Vampire Lord&quot;.</p>
  <p>If your &quot;Dark Flare Knight&quot; is sent to the Graveyard while &quot;Skill Drain&quot; is active, its effect activates in the Graveyard so you can Special Summon &quot;Mirage Knight&quot; (but &quot;Mirage Knight&quot;&#39;s effects will be negated once it is in play).</p>
  <p>If your &quot;Neko Mane King&quot; is sent to the Graveyard by your opponent&#39;s card effect while &quot;Skill Drain&quot; is active, its effect is activated.</p>
  <p>If your &quot;Twin-Headed Behemoth&quot; is destroyed and sent to the Graveyard while &quot;Skill Drain&quot; is active, its effect activates and it is Special Summoned.</p>
  <p>“Skill Drain” will not negate an Ignition Effect or Trigger Effect if the Effect Monster is not face-up on the field when the effect resolves.</p>
  <p>&quot;Skill Drain&quot; does not stop you from activating Ignition Effects, but it does negate their effects as long as the Effect Monster remains on the field. If you Tribute &quot;Cannon Soldier&quot; to itself while &quot;Skill Drain&quot; is active, &quot;Cannon Soldier&quot;&#39;s effect is not negated because &quot;Cannon Soldier&quot; is in the Graveyard, but if you Tribute a different monster for &quot;Cannon Soldier&quot;&#39;s effect, then the effect is negated and your opponent takes no damage. Likewise, if you activate &quot;Winged Minion&quot;&#39;s effect while &quot;Skill Drain&quot; is active, &quot;Winged Minion&quot; is no longer on the field and its effect resolves. If you activate &quot;Exiled Force&quot;&#39;s effect while &quot;Skill Drain&quot; is active, &quot;Exiled Force&quot; is no longer on the field and you can select and destroy 1 monster on the field. If you Tribute &quot;Paladin of White Dragon&quot; to activate its effect while &quot;Skill Drain&quot; is active, it is no longer on the field and you can Special Summon &quot;Blue-Eyes White Dragon&quot;. If you Tribute &quot;Great Dezard&quot; while &quot;Skill Drain&quot; is active, it is no longer on the field and you can Special Summon &quot;Fushioh Richie&quot;.</p>
  <p>&quot;Skill Drain&quot; will negate Flip Effects, and you can chain the activation of &quot;Skill Drain&quot; to the activation of a Flip Effect, but you cannot activate &quot;Skill Drain&quot; in the Damage Step because it does not specifically modify ATK or DEF, so you cannot chain &quot;Skill Drain&quot; to a Flip Effect that is activated because a monster was attacked while face-down.</p>
  <p>If you Flip Summon &quot;Spear Cretin&quot; while &quot;Skill Drain&quot; is active, &quot;Spear Cretin&quot;&#39;s effect is negated when it is sent to the Graveyard because it is a Flip Effect and &quot;Skill Drain&quot; negates Flip Effects.</p>
  <p>&quot;Skill Drain&quot; negates Multi-Trigger Effects such as &quot;Dark Paladin&quot; and &quot;Ryu Senshi&quot;.</p>
  <p>While &quot;Skill Drain&quot; is active you cannot Tribute a face-up &quot;Kaiser Seahorse&quot; to Tribute Summon a Level 7 or higher LIGHT monster. However, you can Tribute a face-down &quot;Kaiser Seahorse&quot;.</p>
  <p>While &quot;Skill Drain&quot; is active, &quot;maintenance costs&quot; are not negated (see the Advanced Gameplay FAQ) so you still have to pay for &quot;The Unfriendly Amazon&quot;, &quot;Armor Exe&quot;, Archfiends, etc. However, all other costs are negated, so you do not have to pay to attack with &quot;Dark Elf&quot; or &quot;Jirai Gumo&quot;.</p>
  <p>Restrictions are also lifted, so you can attack with &quot;Ultimate Obedient Fiend&quot; even if you have other cards on your side of the field.</p>
  <p>Spirit Monsters are not returned to the owner&#39;s hand while &quot;Skill Drain&quot; is active.</p>
  <p>Toon Monsters&#39; effects are negated while &quot;Skill Drain&quot; is active and the Toon Monster is on the field, so they can attack the same turn they are Summoned, you do not have to pay 500 Life Points to attack with them, and they are not destroyed if &quot;Toon World&quot; is destroyed, but they cannot attack your opponent directly.</p>
  <p>&quot;Jinzo&quot; cannot negate Trap Cards while &quot;Skill Drain&quot; is already active, because &quot;Skill Drain&quot; is negating &quot;Jinzo&quot;&#39;s effect. But if &quot;Jinzo&quot; is already on the field, you cannot activate &quot;Skill Drain&quot; because &quot;Jinzo&quot;&#39;s effect prevents you from doing so.</p>
  <p>When a monster&#39;s ATK or DEF are changed by its own effect, like &quot;Slate Warrior&quot; or &quot;Berserk Dragon&quot;, and &quot;Skill Drain&quot; is activated, that monster&#39;s effect is negated and the ATK/DEF are returned to normal. Even if &quot;Skill Drain&quot; is then destroyed, the old adjustment to ATK/DEF does not come back. Any bonuses or penalties are lost when &quot;Skill Drain&quot; effect is applied, and you have to start over from the beginning.</p>
  <p>If your opponent uses &quot;Bazoo the Soul-Eater&quot;&#39;s effect to increase its ATK, and you use &quot;Skill Drain&quot;, &quot;Bazoo the Soul-Eater&quot;&#39;s ATK returns to normal, even if &quot;Skill Drain&quot; is destroyed after resolving. If &quot;Skill Drain&quot; is negating &quot;Bazoo the Soul-Eater&quot;&#39;s effect, you can still pay the cost and remove monsters in your Graveyard from play, but &quot;Bazoo the Soul-Eater&quot;&#39;s ATK will not increase.</p>
  <p>&quot;Goblin Attack Force&quot; and &quot;Spear Dragon&quot; do not change their battle position after attacking while &quot;Skill Drain&quot; is active. If &quot;Goblin Attack Force&quot; attacks and changes battle position, then on your next turn you activate &quot;Skill Drain&quot;, you can change &quot;Goblin Attack Force&quot; back to Attack Position because its effect that prevents this is negated.</p>
  <p>Monsters equipped to &quot;Relinquished&quot; while &quot;Skill Drain&quot; is active are negated and destroyed because &quot;Relinquished&quot; no longer has an effect that allows it to be equipped with a monster, and &quot;Relinquished&quot;&#39;s ATK and DEF are returned to normal.</p>
  <p>Monsters that can hold Spell Counters, like &quot;Skilled Dark Magician&quot;, no longer have that effect while &quot;Skill Drain&quot; is active, so they cannot gain more Spell Counters and all Spell Counters already placed on them are removed.</p>
  <p>If a face-down &quot;Kisetai&quot; is attacked while &quot;Skill Drain&quot; is active, the effect of &quot;Kisetai&quot; is negated, damage calculation is performed, and &quot;Kisetai&quot; will not equip itself to the attacking monster. But if &quot;Kisetai&quot; is already an Equip Spell Card, and &quot;Skill Drain&quot; is activated, Kisetai is unaffected because it is no longer an Effect Monster.</p>
  <p>The effects of &quot;Zombyra the Dark&quot; are negated while &quot;Skill Drain&quot; is active, so &quot;Zombyra the Dark&quot; can attack your opponent directly, and its ATK is not decreased because of its effect. If &quot;Skill Drain&quot; is destroyed, &quot;Zombyra the Dark&quot;&#39;s ATK is not changed.</p>
  <p>The ATK and DEF of &quot;Gradius&#39; Option&quot;, the ATK of &quot;Maju Garzett&quot;, and similar monsters is 0 while &quot;Skill Drain&quot; is active, and is not restored even if &quot;Skill Drain&quot; is destroyed.</p>
  <p>If &quot;Skill Drain&quot; is activated after &quot;Hayabusa Knight&quot;&#39;s first attack, &quot;Hayabusa Knight&quot; does not get its second attack.</p>
  <p>You can Special Summon &quot;Gilasaurus&quot; while &quot;Skill Drain&quot; is active, but its effect is negated so your opponent does not get to Special Summon.</p>
  <p>Do not roll dice for Archfiends while &quot;Skill Drain&quot; is active.</p>
  <p>A Union Monster that attached itself to another monster before &quot;Skill Drain&quot; became active is unaffected by &quot;Skill Drain&quot;. If &quot;Skill Drain&quot; is active, you can activate a Union Monster&#39;s effect to attach it to another monster, but nothing happens and it remains a monster.</p>
  <p>&quot;Skill Drain&quot; will not affect lingering effects or conditions that are left over from a previous effect. For example, if you Special Summon a Fusion Monster with &quot;Summoner of Illusions&quot;, and then &quot;Skill Drain&quot; is activated afterwards, the Fusion Monster is still destroyed in the End Phase. If you Special Summon a Fusion Monster with &quot;Magical Scientist&quot;, and then &quot;Skill Drain&quot; is activated, the Fusion Monster cannot attack your opponent&#39;s Life Points directly, and is returned to the Fusion Deck at the end of the turn.</p>

  <p>If &quot;Hino-Kagu-Tsuchi&quot;&#39;s effect is activated, and then &quot;Skill Drain&quot; is activated later, &quot;Hino-Kagu-Tsuchi&quot;&#39;s effect is not negated and the opponent must discard his/her hand during their next Draw Phase.

  <p>If &quot;Blade Knight&quot; destroys a Flip Effect Monster like &quot;Slate Warrior&quot;, even that monster’s non-Flip effects are negated. So in this case, &quot;Slate Warrior&quot; does not reduce the ATK and DEF of the &quot;Blade Knight&quot; that destroyed it, because &quot;Blade Knight&quot; negates its effect.</p>
  <p>&quot;Gorgon’s Eye&quot; cannot negate the effect of &quot;Sangan&quot;, &quot;Witch of the Black Forest&quot;, or &quot;Sinister Serpent&quot; because they activate in the Graveyard. If a Defense Position &quot;Slate Warrior&quot; is attacked and destroyed, the effect of &quot;Slate Warrior&quot; that lowers ATK and DEF is applied because it activates in the Graveyard.</p>
  <p>If &quot;Grave Protector&quot; is on the field, the effect of &quot;Slate Warrior&quot; that reduces the ATK and DEF of the monster that destroys &quot;Slate Warrior&quot; is still applied, even though &quot;Slate Warrior&quot; is shuffled back into the Deck instead of being sent to the Graveyard.

  <p>Q: If a player has all 5 Monster Zone spaces full when their opponent’s “Snatch Steal” is destroyed, what will happen to the monster their opponent was controlling with the destroyed “Snatch Steal”?</p>

  <p>Q: If I have used “Snatch Steal” on a monster from another turn and activate “Tailor of the Fickle” on “Snatch Steal,” can I steal another monster and keep both, or do I only get one?</p>
  <p>A: You would keep the new equipped monster. The monster formerly equipped with “Snatch Steal” would return to your opponent&#39;s side of the field. Steve Okegawa, 12/14/2003</p>
  <p>Q: Can “Change of Heart” or “Snatch Steal” be activated to destroy an opponent’s monster if all 5 Monster Zone spaces are full or does it only happen during the resolution of a chain?</p>
  <p>A: It is during the resolution of a chain. If you do not have any empty zones in your Monster Zone you cannot activate &quot;Change of Heart&quot; or &quot;Snatch Steal&quot; to take control of an opponent&#39;s monster. Curtis Schultz, 01/29/2004</p>

  <p>You can activate the effect of “Spark Blaster” multiple times in the same Main Phase. You can activate the effect of “Spark Blaster” during the same turn you played it from your hand.</p>
  <p>You can chain to “Spark Blaster” when its effect is used. After its effect is used 3 times, you cannot chain to the destruction of “Spark Blaster”.</p>
  <p>If “Silent Swordsman LV7” is on the field when “Spark Blaster’s” effect is used for the third time, “Spark Blaster” is still destroyed normally.</p>

  <h4 id='spatial-collapsea-idspatial-collapsea'>SPATIAL COLLAPSE<a id="SPATIAL COLLAPSE"></a></h4>
  <p>Individual Card FAQs:</p>
  <p>If &quot;Spatial Collapse&quot; is activated, and an effect is chained so that a player has more than 5 cards on the field after &quot;Spatial Collapse&quot; resolves, the controller selects cards to send to the Graveyard to make the number 5.</p>
  <p>You can activate &quot;Spatial Collapse&quot; when you have 5 or less cards on the field and your opponent has 5 or less cards on the field.</p>
  <p>&quot;Spatial Collapse&quot; includes Tokens, too.</p>
  <p>While &quot;Spatial Collapse&quot; is active and you have 1 or more cards already on your side of the field, you cannot activate &quot;Scapegoat&quot; because you would have your 1 previous card + the &quot;Scapegoat&quot; card + 4 monster tokens = 6.</p>
  <p>When you have 4 cards on your side of the field while &quot;Spatial Collapse&quot; is active, you cannot activate &quot;Change of Heart&quot;.</p>
  <p>When &quot;Cyber Jar&quot; is activated while &quot;Spatial Collapse&quot; is active, if the number of cards exceeds 5, each player selects cards to send to the Graveyard to make the number 5.</p>
  <p>When you have 4 cards on the field and you activate &quot;Remove Brainwashing&quot;, you select cards to destroy to make the number of cards you control 5.</p>

  <p>When a card that selects a card in the Graveyard as a target, such as &quot;Monster Reborn&quot;, &quot;Mask of Darkness&quot;, &quot;Magician of Faith&quot;, &quot;Spear Cretin&quot;, or &quot;The Shallow Grave&quot;, is activated, you may chain &quot;Disappear&quot; to remove the targeted card from play, and the &quot;Monster Reborn&quot;, etc., will resolve without effect. This is because these cards select their target at activation, not resolution.</p>
  <p>If you Flip Summon &quot;Spear Cretin&quot; while &quot;Skill Drain&quot; is active, &quot;Spear Cretin&quot;&#39;s effect is negated when it is sent to the Graveyard because it is a Flip Effect and &quot;Skill Drain&quot; negates Flip Effects.</p>
  <p>If &quot;The End of Anubis&quot; is face-up on the field when a flipped &quot;Spear Cretin&quot; is sent to the Graveyard, then &quot;Spear Cretin&#39;s&quot; effect does not activate. But if &quot;The End of Anubis&quot; was merely on the field when &quot;Spear Cretin&quot; was flipped, but is NOT on the field when &quot;Spear Cretin&quot; is sent to the Graveyard, then &quot;Spear Cretin&#39;s&quot; effect DOES activate when sent to the Graveyard because &quot;The End of Anubis&quot; is no longer on the field to negate it.</p>

  <p>&quot;Spear Dragon&quot; will change to Defense Position after it attacks, regardless of the battle position of the opponent’s monster.</p>
  <p>The effect of &quot;Spear Dragon&quot; does not prevent you from manually changing its battle position later on. Of course, you cannot change it in the same turn after you attacked with &quot;Spear Dragon&quot;. But during your next turn you can change it back to Attack Position (and attack again the same turn, if you choose).</p>
  <p>If you attack your opponent’s Defense Position monster with 0 DEF with your &quot;Spear Dragon&quot;, and have &quot;Dragon’s Rage&quot; active on the field, the opponent only takes 1900 points of damage. The effects are not cumulative.</p>
  <p>The effect of &quot;Lord of D.&quot; will not prevent the effect of &quot;Spear Dragon&quot; from changing it to Defense Position after it attacks.</p>

  <p>Individual Card FAQs:</p>
  <p>The effect of “Spell Absorption” is applied when the Spell Card is activated. You cannot chain to this effect. The effect is applied immediately. For example, when activating “Tribute to the Doomed” while “Spell Absorption” is on the field: (1) pay the cost by discarding a card, (2) activate “Tribute to the Doomed”, (3) your Life Points increase for “Spell Absorption”, (4) check for chaining and resolve “Tribute to the Doomed”.</p>
  <p>If the activation of a Spell Card is negated by “Magic Jammer”, etc., then you will not gain Life Points for “Spell Absorption”.</p>
  <p>A Spell Card used from the Graveyard by the effect of “Double Spell” is not considered “activated”, so you will only gain Life Points for “Spell Absorption” for “Double Spell” itself, not for the card used from the Graveyard.</p>
  <p>When you activate “Spell Absorption”, you do not gain Life Points for activating “Spell Absorption” itself.</p>

  <p>You can Special Summon &quot;Spell Canceller&quot; with &quot;Premature Burial&quot;; the effect of &quot;Premature Burial&quot; is negated by &quot;Spell Canceller&quot; so if &quot;Premature Burial&quot; is destroyed, &quot;Spell Canceller&quot; is not destroyed and remains on the field.</p>
  <p>You can chain &quot;Call of the Haunted&quot; to a Spell Card, and Special Summon &quot;Spell Canceller&quot;, to negate the effect of the Spell Card.</p>
  <p>You can activate &quot;Spiritualism&quot; when &quot;Spell Canceller&quot; is face-up on the field because its activation and effect cannot be negated.</p>
  <p>When &quot;Spell Canceller&quot; is face-up on the field, you can activate the Graveyard effect of &quot;Dark Necrofear&quot; (because it is a monster effect) and equip it to a monster, but the effect of &quot;Dark Necrofear&quot; after it is equipped will be negated because it is then an Equip Spell Card.</p>

  <p>This card may select a face-down monster as a target. This prevents the monster from being Flip Summoned, but it will still be flipped face-up if it is the target of an attack.</p>
  <p>If the targeted monster is Tributed, changed into an Equip Spell Card by the effect of &quot;Relinquished&quot;, returned to the owner’s hand, or otherwise removed from the field without being destroyed, &quot;Spellbinding Circle&quot; remains on the field meaninglessly.</p>
  <p>You can chain &quot;Spellbinding Circle&quot; to the activation of a Flip Effect when a monster is Flip Summoned or flipped face-up, but it will not negate the activation or resolution of the Flip Effect.</p>

  <p>&quot;Spirit of the Pharaoh&quot; cannot be Normal Summoned or Set, and cannot be Special Summoned EXCEPT by the effect of &quot;The First Sarcophagus&quot;. So &quot;Spirit of the Pharaoh&quot; cannot be Special Summoned with &quot;Monster Reborn&quot;, etc., even if Special Summoned properly first.</p>
  <p>If your opponent chains &quot;Royal Decree&quot; to the effect of &quot;The First Sarcophagus&quot;, the effect of Special Summoning is negated and &quot;The First Sarcophagus&quot; is sent to the Graveyard because that is the cost.</p>
  <p>If &quot;Banisher of the Light&quot; is in play and you activate &quot;The First Sarcophagus&quot;, you cannot Special Summon &quot;Spirit of the Pharaoh&quot;.</p>

  <h4 id='spirit-reapera-idspirit-reapera'>SPIRIT REAPER<a id="SPIRIT REAPER"></a></h4>
  <p>Individual Card FAQs:</p>
  <p>While in Defense Position, &quot;Spirit Reaper&quot; will stop all Battle Damage to your Life Points from most monsters, but monsters like &quot;Spear Dragon&quot; and those equipped with &quot;Fairy Meteor Crush&quot; can still inflict Battle Damage to your Life Points with their effects.</p>
  <p>If attacked while face-down, &quot;Spirit Reaper&quot; flips face-up and its effect preventing it from being destroyed will be applied during damage calculation, so &quot;Spirit Reaper&quot; will not be destroyed by the attack.</p>
  <p>If &quot;Spirit Reaper&quot; is attacked by &quot;Dark Ruler Ha Des&quot;, &quot;Spirit Reaper&quot; isn’t destroyed during damage calculation, so the effect of &quot;Dark Ruler Ha Des&quot; does not activate.</p>
  <p>When &quot;Spirit Reaper&quot; is targeted by an effect, &quot;Spirit Reaper&quot; is destroyed by its own effect AFTER resolving the effect that targeted it. For example, if &quot;Spirit Reaper&quot; attacks and &quot;Magic Cylinder&quot; is activated, designating &quot;Spirit Reaper&quot;, first &quot;Magic Cylinder&quot; will resolve, negate the attack, and inflict 300 damage to the controller of &quot;Spirit Reaper&quot;. Then, after that, &quot;Spirit Reaper&quot; is destroyed by its effect.</p>
  <p>&quot;Spirit Reaper&quot; is destroyed by its own effect after a card that targets it resolves. If a Spell Card targets it, and the activation of that Spell Card is negated (such as with &quot;Magic Jammer&quot;), then &quot;Spirit Reaper&quot; is not destroyed. However, if the effect of the Spell Card was negated, such as if &quot;Imperial Order&quot; is active, then &quot;Spirit Reaper&quot; is destroyed because the Spell Card resolves (even though its effect is negated). Even if &quot;Imperial Order&quot; is already active on the field, you can activate a card such as &quot;Tribute to the Doomed&quot; designating &quot;Spirit Reaper&quot;, and &quot;Spirit Reaper&quot; will be destroyed by its own effect.</p>
  <p>&quot;Spirit Reaper&quot; is only destroyed by its own effect if it is face-up on the field when the effect designating it as a target activates, AND after the effect designating it as a target resolves. If you Special Summon &quot;Spirit Reaper&quot; with Monster Reborn, or flip it face-down with &quot;Book of Moon&quot;, or flip it face-up with &quot;Book of Taiyou&quot;, it is not destroyed. If a face-down &quot;Spirit Reaper&quot; is targeted with &quot;Change of Heart&quot;, then Flip Summoned, it is not destroyed because it was face-down when &quot;Change of Heart&quot; was activated. If &quot;Spirit Reaper&quot; is targeted by the effect of &quot;Relinquished&quot;, &quot;Spirit Reaper&quot; is an Equip Spell Card after the effect of &quot;Relinquished&quot; resolves, so it is not destroyed. If &quot;Spirit Reaper&quot; is removed from play with &quot;Dimensionhole&quot; or &quot;Interdimensional Matter Transporter&quot; or &quot;Different Dimension Gate&quot;, then it is removed from play so it is not destroyed. If &quot;Spirit Reaper&quot; is shuffled into the Deck with &quot;Monster Recovery&quot;, it’s not destroyed. If &quot;Spirit Reaper&quot; is returned to the hand with &quot;Penguin Soldier&quot;, it’s not destroyed.</p>
  <p>If &quot;Spirit Reaper&quot; is destroyed by its effect during the Damage Step, such as if &quot;Rush Recklessly&quot; was activated to increase its ATK, destroy &quot;Spirit Reaper&quot; with its effect AFTER damage calculation.</p>
  <p>&quot;Spirit Reaper&quot; is destroyed if equipped, including with &quot;Heart of Clear Water&quot;.</p>
  <p>Examples of cards that will not destroy &quot;Spirit Reaper&quot; because they do not target: &quot;Creature Swap&quot;, &quot;Adhesion Trap Hole&quot;, &quot;Spear Dragon&quot;.</p>
  <p>Since &quot;Soul Exchange&quot; targets, &quot;Spirit Reaper&quot; is destroyed by its own effect before you can Tribute it.</p>
  <p>&quot;Spirit Reaper&quot; has a special effect for when it isn’t destroyed (as a result of battle), and a special effect for an extra reason to destroy it (when targeted by an effect). But it can still be destroyed by all other normal effects that would destroy a monster: &quot;Cyber Jar&quot;, &quot;Raigeki&quot;, etc.</p>
  <p>If &quot;Spirit Reaper&quot; is Special Summoned with &quot;Premature Burial&quot; or &quot;Call of the Haunted&quot;, &quot;Spirit Reaper&quot; is destroyed after it is Special Summoned because it is targeted by an effect.</p>
  <p>&quot;Spirit Reaper&quot; only forces your opponent to discard when &quot;Spirit Reaper&quot; attacks directly (such as when your opponent has no monsters on the field), AND when it inflicts at least 1 point of damage to the opponent’s Life Points. So if your opponent uses &quot;Kuriboh&quot;, &quot;Waboku&quot;, or &quot;Tornado Wall&quot; to prevent the damage, &quot;Spirit Reaper&quot; does not force the opponent to discard.</p>
  <p>&quot;Dreamsprite&quot; targets 1 of your own monsters. If &quot;Spirit Reaper&quot; is targeted, it is destroyed after damage calculation.</p>
  <p>&quot;Patrician of Darkness&quot; does not target, so &quot;Spirit Reaper&quot; is not destroyed if you use &quot;Patrician of Darkness&quot; to force your opponent to attack it.</p>
  <p>If &quot;Spirit Reaper&quot; is targeted by &quot;Riryoku&quot;, it is destroyed, but the increase to the other monster’s ATK lasts until the end of the turn as normal.</p>
  <p>If a Spellcaster affected by &quot;Diffusion Wave-Motion&quot; attacks &quot;Spirit Reaper&quot;, it’s just a normal attack. &quot;Spirit Reaper&quot; is not being targeted by &quot;Diffusion Wave-Motion&quot;.</p>
  <p>If &quot;Skill Drain&quot; is active, &quot;Spirit Reaper&quot; can be equiped with Equip Cards, but if &quot;Skill Drain&quot; is later removed from the field &quot;Spirit Reaper&quot; wil be destroyed.</p>
  <p>&quot;Spirit Reaper&quot; can be destroyed as a result of battle while &quot;Skill Drain&quot; is active.</p>
  <p>Netrep Rulings:</p>
  <p>If “Spirit Reaper” is targeted by a card during the Damage Step, Damage Calculation resolves as normal and then “Spirit Reaper” will destroy itself by its effect.</p>
  <p>If “Gravekeeper’s Assailant” attacks and targets “Spirit Reaper” with its effect, “Spirit Reaper” will destroy itself by its effect and a replay will occur.</p>
  <p>Netrep Q&amp;As:</p>
  <p>Q: Bob activates Snatch Steal targeting Spirit Reaper. Andrew chains Mystical Space Typhoon to destroy Snatch Steal. Does Spirit Reaper still destroy itself?</p>
  <p>A: &quot;Spirit Reaper&quot; is destroyed after the card that targets it resolves. &quot;Snatch Steal&quot; is an Equip Card. Since &quot;Snatch Steal&quot; was destroyed before it could resolve, it&#39;s effect disappears and does not resolve. Since &quot;Snatch Steal&quot; doesn&#39;t resolve, &quot;Spirit Reaper&quot; is not destroyed. Curtis Schultz, 11/09/2005</p>

  <p>You gain 500 Life Points each time a monster or monsters on the field are returned to their owner’s hand. So if &quot;Penguin Soldier&quot; returns two monsters at once, you only gain 500 Life Points.</p>
  <p>Spirit Monsters are sent to the owner’s hand one at a time during the End Phase. So if you have 4 face-up Spirit Monsters during the End Phase, you will gain 500 Life Points for each, totaling 2000 Life Points.</p>

  <p>Individual Card FAQs:</p>
  <p>When you activate this card, if the opponent activates an effect in a chain that destroys the targeted Spell or Trap Card, the opponent will not take the 500 points of damage. If your opponent merely chains the Spell or Trap card that you targeted, the Spell or Trap Card will be destroyed when &quot;Stamping Destruction&quot; resolves and your opponent will take 500 points of damage. (Remember that Spell and Trap Cards remain on the field until the entire chain resolves, unless destroyed by a card effect during the chain.)</p>

  <p>The effect of &quot;Statue of the Wicked&quot; is activated in the Graveyard, so its effect is activated even if &quot;Jinzo&quot; is on the field, because &quot;Jinzo&quot; only applies to Trap Cards and Trap Card effects on the field. Also, cards like &quot;Seven Tools of the Bandit&quot; cannot be used against &quot;Statue of the Wicked&quot;.</p>
  <p>&quot;Statue of the Wicked&quot; activates its effect even if it is destroyed on the same turn it was Set.</p>
  <p>If &quot;Banisher of the Light&quot; is in play, then &quot;Statue of the Wicked&quot; does not activate its effect when destroyed, because it is not sent to the Graveyard.</p>

  <p>If your monster selected with &quot;Staunch Defender&quot; is destroyed, your opponent&#39;s remaining monsters cannot attack.</p>
  <p>When your opponent chains &quot;Ring of Destruction&quot; to your &quot;Staunch Defender&quot; to destroy the selected monster, the effect of &quot;Staunch Defender&quot; is negated and battle is conducted normally.</p>
  <p>While &quot;Staunch Defender&quot; is active, your opponent must still pay costs to attack with &quot;Dark Elf&quot;, etc., if he/she attacks with that monster.</p>
  <p>You cannot select &quot;Guardian Kay&#39;est&quot; or &quot;The Legendary Fisherman&quot; for &quot;Staunch Defender&quot; if they cannot be attacked.</p>
  <p>You can activate &quot;Staunch Defender&quot; when a monster affected by &quot;Diffusion Wave Motion&quot; declares an attack. The monster affected by &quot;Diffusion Wave Motion&quot; will then attack your selected monster once (and only once).</p>
  <p>When you select &quot;Spirit Reaper&quot; or &quot;The Reaper on the Nightmare&quot; as the target of &quot;Staunch Defender&quot;, resolve the chain, and after the effect of &quot;Staunch Defender&quot; resolves, the selected monster is destroyed. A replay will occur, but the opponent can no longer attack because the selected monster is gone.</p>
  <p>If two &quot;Staunch Defenders&quot; are activated during the same turn, the last one to resolve will be the one that applies.</p>
  <p>If &quot;Absolute End&quot; and &quot;Staunch Defender&quot; are both activated during the same turn, the last one to resolve will be the one that applies.</p>
  <p>Netrep Rulings:</p>
  <p>Monsters summoned after “Staunch Defender” resolves must attack the designated monster.</p>
  <p>If the monster designated by “Staunch Defender” is destroyed or leaves the field, the opponent’s monsters may no longer attack.</p>
  <p>“Staunch Defender” may only designate a legal attack target.</p>
  <p>Monsters that have attacked before “Staunch Defender” was activated may not attack again, unless that monster was able to attack a second time normally.</p>
  <p>Netrep Q&amp;As:</p>
  <p>Q: If “Thousand-Eyes Restrict” declares an attack and the opponent activates “Staunch Defender”, will all other face-up monsters have to attack?</p>
  <p>A: It depends on &quot;Thousand Eyes Restrict&quot; surviving the attack. If the &quot;Thousand Eyes Restrict&quot; survives the attack (due to Battle Damage or its effect), then no other monster will be allowed to attack. If it does not survive and is sent to the Graveyard or otherwise removed from the field, then any other face-up monsters on your side of the field would have to attack the selected monster.

  <p>Q: Can &quot;Strike Ninja&quot; return in the End Phase if my monster zones are full from having activated &quot;Return from the Different Dimension&quot; previously this turn?</p>
  <p>A: Yes. Since both &quot;Strike Ninja&quot; and &quot;Return from the Different Dimension&quot; will resolve in the End Phase you can choose in which order this will happen. You can choose to resolve &quot;Return from the Different Dimension&quot; and then resolve &quot;Strike Ninja&quot;. In this instance &quot;Strike Ninja&quot; will return to the field. If you choose to resolve &quot;Strike Ninja&quot; before &quot;Return from the Different Dimension&quot; then it will be sent to the graveyard. <!-- -added on 03/07/2022; verified by Asta from GoatFormat.com --></p>

  <p>&quot;Stumbling&quot; changes a monster to face-up Defense Position, not face-down Defense Position.</p>
  <p>When &quot;Stumbling&quot; and &quot;Final Attack Orders&quot; are both active, a Summoned monster is changed to Defense Position, then changed to Attack Position.</p>
  <p>If &quot;Stumbling&quot; is in effect and you Summon &quot;Exiled Force&quot;, and your opponent has &quot;Trap Hole&quot; Set, &quot;Stumbling&quot; initiates a chain with &quot;Stumbling&quot;&#39;s effect as Step 1. Your opponent can activate &quot;Trap Hole&quot; as Step 2. You cannot chain &quot;Exiled Force&quot; because its effect is Spell Speed 1.

  <p>While &quot;Imperial Order&quot; and &quot;Talisman of Trap Sealing&quot; are both active, and &quot;Sealmaster Meisei&quot; is removed from the field, &quot;Talisman of Trap Sealing&quot; stays on the field, but if &quot;Imperial Order&quot;&#39;s effect is no longer being applied, &quot;Talisman of Trap Sealing&quot; is destroyed.</p>
  <p>&quot;Talisman of Trap Sealing&quot; is destroyed immediately when &quot;Sealmaster Meisei&quot; is not on the field. If your opponent chains &quot;Ring of Destruction&quot; to &quot;Talisman of Trap Sealing&quot; to destroy &quot;Sealmaster Meisei&quot;, &quot;Talisman of Trap Sealing&quot; is immediately destroyed when &quot;Ring of Destruction&quot; resolves.</p>
  <p>If you have &quot;Talisman of Spell Sealing&quot; and &quot;Talisman of Trap Sealing&quot;, the controller can select which effect will be applied. If both players have both, the turn player chooses which effect is applied.</p>
  <p>If you have &quot;Talisman of Trap Sealing&quot; and &quot;Sealmaster Meisei&quot; is destroyed in a battle that causes you to take 2000 or more damage, you cannot activate &quot;Nutrient Z&quot;.</p>

  <h4 id='taunta-idtaunta'>TAUNT<a id="TAUNT"></a></h4>
  <p>Individual Card FAQs:</p>
  <p>If a monster selected by &quot;Taunt&quot; is moved to the turn player’s side of the field, the turn player can conduct attacks normally without worrying about the effect of &quot;Taunt&quot;, because without a card effect that allows it, a player cannot attack monsters on his own side of the field.</p>
  <p>If multiple monsters are selected by multiple &quot;Taunts&quot;, the turn player selects 1 of the monsters selected by &quot;Taunt&quot; and can attack it.</p>
  <p>If 1 monster is selected by &quot;Taunt&quot; and another is equipped with &quot;Ring of Magnetism&quot;, the turn player must attack the monster equipped with &quot;Ring of Magnetism&quot; if he attacks.</p>

  <p>Individual Card FAQs:</p>
  <p>When your only Archfiend monster is an Equip Spell Card equipped to &quot;Relinquished&quot;, you cannot Normal Summon or Flip Summon &quot;Terrorking Archfiend&quot;.</p>
  <p>While &quot;Skill Drain&quot; is active, you still need to have an Archfiend Monster Card on your side of the field in order to Normal Summon or Flip Summon &quot;Terrorking Archfiend&quot;.</p>
  <p>You can Set or Special Summon a &quot;Terrorking Archfiend&quot; even if there are no Archfiend Monster Cards on your side of the field.</p>

  <p>You get the &quot;Mystical Shine Ball&quot; when &quot;The Agent of Creation - Venus&quot;&#39; effect resolves.</p>
  <p>You have to shuffle your Deck after searching for the &quot;Mystical Shine Ball&quot;.</p>
  <p>After Summoning &quot;The Agent of Creation - Venus&quot;, you can activate its effect before your opponent can activate &quot;Trap Hole&quot;.</p>

  <p>Vs. &quot;Reverse Trap&quot;, &quot;The Agent of Force - Mars&quot;&#39; ATK &amp; DEF become zero but cannot go below zero.</p>
  <p>If &quot;The Agent of Force - Mars&quot; attacks &quot;Reflect Bounder&quot;, &quot;Reflect Bounder&quot; deals damage based on &quot;The Agent of Force - Mars&quot;&#39; current ATK, so if it has 2000 ATK, then &quot;Reflect Bounder&quot; inflicts 2000 damage; then recalculate &quot;The Agent of Force - Mars&quot;&#39; ATK before performing damage calculation.</p>
  <p>When your face-down Defense Position &quot;The Agent of Force - Mars&quot; is attacked, its DEF is increased BEFORE damage calculation.</p>

  <p>Individual Card FAQs:</p>
  <p>Tributing &quot;The Agent of Judgment - Saturn&quot; is a cost.</p>
  <p>You cannot activate &quot;The Agent of Judgment - Saturn&quot;&#39;s effect during Main Phase 2. You CAN activate &quot;The Agent of Judgment - Saturn&quot;&#39;s effect during Main Phase 1 even if you have to skip your Battle Phase because of a card effect.</p>
  <p>You can activate multiple &quot;The Agent of Judgment - Saturns&quot;&#39; effects in the same turn.</p>
  <p>You can chain &quot;Barrel Behind the Door&quot; to &quot;The Agent of Judgment - Saturn&quot;&#39;s effect.</p>
  <p>If you chain &quot;Mystical Space Typhoon&quot; to &quot;The Agent of Judgment - Saturn&quot;&#39;s effect and destroy &quot;The Sanctuary in the Sky&quot;, &quot;The Agent of Judgment - Saturn&quot;&#39;s effect disappears but it has already been Tributed so it is sent to the Graveyard.</p>
  <p>If &quot;The Sanctuary in the Sky&quot; is not on the field, you can Tribute &quot;The Agent of Judgment - Saturn&quot; and activate the effect, but the effect is not applied and disappears.</p>
  <p>If an effect is chained to &quot;The Agent of Judgment - Saturn&quot;&#39;s effect that would increase your opponent&#39;s Life Points, so that your opponent&#39;s Life Points are higher than yours when its effect resolves, then &quot;The Agent of Judgment - Saturn&quot;&#39;s effect disappears because your Life Points need to be higher than your opponent&#39;s when the effect resolves.</p>
  <p>Damage is calculated and inflicted when the effect resolves, so calculate the exact damage when resolving the effect, including any chained effects that altered the Life Points since activation; if the Life Points have changed since activation, the damage inflicted changes accordingly.</p>

  <p>Individual Card FAQs:</p>
  <p>When it is the END of your opponent&#39;s End Phase and you have no hand, then &quot;The Agent of Wisdom - Mercury&quot;&#39;s effect activates. So if you activate &quot;Dust Tornado&quot; during your opponent&#39;s End Phase, and Set your last card in your hand, and have no cards at the end of the End Phase, &quot;The Agent of Wisdom - Mercury&quot;&#39;s effect activates.</p>
  <p>If your hand was increased during the End Phase by activating &quot;Jar of Greed&quot;, and you have a card in your hand at the end of the End Phase, then &quot;The Agent of Wisdom - Mercury&quot;&#39;s effect does not activate.</p>
  <p>If your Standby Phase is skipped then &quot;The Agent of Wisdom - Mercury&quot;&#39;s effect disappears.</p>
  <p>If you have multiple &quot;The Agent of Wisdom - Mercury&quot; you can draw multiple times.</p>
  <p>When the effect of &quot;The Agent of Wisdom - Mercury&quot; is negated by &quot;Skill Drain&quot;, and you have no hand at the end of your opponent&#39;s End Phase, and you destroy &quot;Skill Drain&quot; before your &quot;Standby Phase&quot; (such as with &quot;Mystical Space Typhoon&quot; during your Draw Phase), you CAN draw because &quot;Skill Drain&quot; was destroyed. This is because the &quot;when you have no cards in your hand during your opponent&#39;s End Phase&quot; is a condition, not an effect, so it is not negated by &quot;Skill Drain&quot;. As long as you can make it so that &quot;Skill Drain&quot; is not negating &quot;The Agent of Wisdom - Mercury&quot;&#39;s card-drawing effect by the time the Standby Phase begins, you can draw.</p>
  <p>When you have &quot;The Agent of Wisdom - Mercury&quot; on your side of the field and you have no cards in your hand at the end of your opponent&#39;s End Phase, but it is destroyed before your Standby Phase (such as with &quot;Ring of Destruction&quot; during your Draw Phase), then you do NOT draw during your Standby Phase because &quot;The Agent of Wisdom - Mercury&quot; is no longer on the field.</p>

  <p>Individual Card FAQs:</p>
  <p>“The Big March of Animals” applies its effect at resolution of the card and does not recalculate during the turn. Its effect lasts as long as the affected monsters remain face-up on the field, or until the End Phase.</p>
  <p>“The Big March of Animals” does not affect monsters Summoned after it resolves.</p>
  <p>“The Big March of Animals” does not count or affect face-down monsters.</p>
  <p>This is not an effect that targets. It is applied to all face-up Beast-Type monsters on your side of the field.</p>

  <h4 id='the-creatora-idthe-creatora'>THE CREATOR<a id="THE CREATOR"></a></h4>
  <p>Individual Card FAQs:</p>
  <p>Sending 1 card from your hand to the Graveyard is not a cost to activate the effect of &quot;The Creator&quot;. It is part of the effect. So if your opponent chains &quot;Disappear&quot; to remove the targeted monster in your Graveyard from play, the effect of &quot;The Creator&quot; disappears and you do not send 1 card from your hand to the Graveyard.</p>
  <p>If you use the effect of &quot;The Creator&quot;, and then it is flipped face-down then flipped face-up again that same turn, you may use the effect of &quot;The Creator&quot; again.</p>
  <p>If you activate the effect of &quot;The Creator&quot;, and it does not resolve because the opponent chains &quot;Skill Drain&quot;, or removes the targeted monster from the Graveyard with &quot;Disappear&quot;, you’ve still used the effect. So you cannot activate its effect again that turn (even if you destroy &quot;Skill Drain&quot;).</p>
  <p>To Special Summon &quot;The Creator&quot; with the effect of &quot;The Creator Incarnate&quot;, you must Tribute a face-up &quot;The Creator Incarnate&quot; from the field, not from your hand, etc.</p>

  <p>Individual Card FAQs:</p>
  <p>When you use this monster’s second effect, you also get its first effect. So this monster enables you to perform a Special Summon of a Fusion Monster without “Polymerization”, etc., and also acts as a “substitute” for one of the Fusion Material Monsters.</p>
  <p>Using the second effect of this monster does not “properly” Fusion Summon the Fusion Monster. So it cannot be revived from the Graveyard, etc. If you use “Polymerization” then you can revive the Fusion Monster from the Graveyard, even if you used this monster as a “substitute” Fusion Material Monster.</p>
  <p>To use the second effect of this monster, you must Tribute this monster plus the legal Fusion Material Monster (s) written on the Fusion Monster. For example, to Special Summon “B. Skull Dragon” you must Tribute “The Dark – Hex-Sealed Fusion” as well as either “Red-Eyes B. Dragon” or “Summoned Skull”.</p>
  <p>This monster’s second effect cannot be used to Special Summon Fusion Monsters that can only be Summoned by Fusion Summon, such as “Dark Paladin”.</p>

  <p>When you first activate this card (flip it face-up) you do not have to activate its effect. You cannot flip this card and activate its effect in the same chain. (See &quot;Chains, Activation, and Resolution&quot; in the Advanced FAQ.)</p>
  <p>If &quot;The Dragon’s Bead&quot; is already face-up on the field, you may activate it multiple times in the same chain, but you must discard 1 card from you hand as a cost for each activation.</p>
  <p>You cannot activate the effect of &quot;The Dragon’s Bead&quot; during the Damage Step.</p>
  <p>You cannot activate the effect of &quot;The Dragon’s Bead&quot; to negate a Trap Card that has already resolved, such as a &quot;Nightmare Wheel&quot; the opponent activated on a previous turn.</p>
  <p>You can only activate the effect of this card to negate a Trap Card that targets a face-up Dragon-Type monster, so it cannot negate &quot;Mirror Force&quot;, &quot;Waboku&quot;, &quot;Torrential Tribute&quot;, &quot;Bottomless Trap Hole&quot;, etc.</p>

  <p>You can chain &quot;The Emperor’s Holiday&quot; to &quot;Premature Burial&quot; and the effect of &quot;Premature Burial&quot; will be negated and the targeted monster will never leave the Graveyard. If &quot;Premature Burial&quot; is already active when you activate &quot;The Emperor’s Holiday&quot; the equipped monster is unaffected.</p>
  <p>Netrep Rulings:</p>
  <p>Union monsters will have their effects negated as long as “The Emperor’s Holiday” is active. Unioned monsters may not return to the monster field as long as “The Emperor’s Holiday” is active.</p>
  <p>&quot;The Emperor’s Holiday” has no effect on the monster equipped to “Thousand Eyes Restrict.”</p>
  <p>Netrep Q&amp;As:</p>
  <p>Q: What happens to “Butterfly Dagger - Elma” when “The Emperor’s Holiday” is activated?</p>
  <p>A: The &quot;Butterfly Dagger - Elma&#39;s&quot; effect would activate if destroyed while &quot;The Emperor&#39;s Holiday&quot; is active. Curtis Schultz, 02/04/2004</p>
  <p>Q: What happens to “Dark Necrofear” (as an Equip Spell Card) when “The Emperor’s Holiday” is activated?</p>
  <p>A: The monster &quot;Dark Necrofear&quot; is equipped would return to its previous controller. The &quot;Dark Necrofear&quot; will remain equipped to the monster. Curtis Schultz, 02/03/2004</p>
  <p>Q: What happens to “Relinquished” (equipped with an opponent’s monster) when “The Emperor’s Holiday” is activated?</p>
  <p>A: &quot;Relinquished&quot; will still retain the ATK and DEF stats of the equipped monster. This would be the same as when &quot;Imperial Order&quot; is active. Curtis Schultz, 02/03/2004</p>

  <p>&quot;The End of Anubis&quot; WILL NOT negate the Special Summon of &quot;Chaos Emperor Dragon - Envoy of the End&quot;, &quot;Black Luster Soldier - Envoy of the Beginning&quot;, &quot;Dark Necrofear&quot;, &quot;Soul of Purity and Light&quot;, etc. (because these involve costs, not effects, and &quot;The End of Anubis&quot; cannot negate paying costs). &quot;The End of Anubis&quot; WILL NOT negate &quot;Strike Ninja&quot;&#39;s effect because removing 2 DARK monsters from the Graveyard is a cost.</p>
  <p>&quot;The End of Anubis&quot; WILL NOT negate the effect of &quot;Fiend Comedian&quot;, &quot;Fiber Jar&quot;, or &quot;Big Burn&quot;.</p>
  <p>You can chain &quot;Call of the Haunted&quot; to your opponent&#39;s effect that targets a card in the Graveyard or activates in the Graveyard to Special Summon &quot;The End of Anubis&quot; and negate that effect.</p>
  <p>&quot;The End of Anubis&quot; negates the Special Summon effect of &quot;Premature Burial&quot; &amp; &quot;Call of the Haunted&quot;, but does not negate the effect that destroys the monster when &quot;Premature Burial&quot;/&quot;Call of the Haunted&quot; is destroyed.</p>
  <p>While &quot;The End of Anubis&quot; is on the field, if you Special Summon &quot;Gilasaurus&quot;, your opponent can&#39;t Special Summon.</p>
  <p>If &quot;The End of Anubis&quot; is face-up on the field when a flipped &quot;Spear Cretin&quot; is sent to the Graveyard, then &quot;Spear Cretin&#39;s&quot; effect does not activate. But if &quot;The End of Anubis&quot; was merely on the field when &quot;Spear Cretin&quot; was flipped, but is NOT on the field when &quot;Spear Cretin&quot; is sent to the Graveyard, then &quot;Spear Cretin&#39;s&quot; effect DOES activate when sent to the Graveyard because &quot;The End of Anubis&quot; is no longer on the field to negate it.</p>
  <p>When &quot;Night Assailant&quot; is discarded to activate the effect of &quot;Tribe-Infecting Virus&quot;, and Fiend is named, the effect of &quot;Night Assailant&quot; is activated after &quot;Tribe-Infecting Virus&quot; resolves because &quot;The End of Anubis&quot; is no longer on the field.</p>
  <p>You cannot send &quot;Desrook Archfiend&quot; to the Graveyard for its effect while &quot;The End of Anubis&quot; is on the field, because the effect of &quot;Desrook Archfiend&quot; targets the destroyed &quot;Terrorking Archfiend&quot; in the Graveyard.</p>
  <p>Judge List Rulings:</p>
  <p>&quot;Exiled Force&quot;, when Tributed for its effect, most certainly DOES activate in the Graveyard. This is the reason that its effect still activates if &quot;Skill Drain&quot; is on the field. Hence, its effect does not [resolve] if &quot;The End of Anubis&quot; is on the field. Kevin Tewart, 4/12/2005</p>
  <p>&quot;The End of Anubis&quot; will not negate the effect of &quot;Wave-Motion Cannon&quot; because the effect of &quot;Wave-Motion Cannon&quot; does not activate in the Graveyard. (This is the exact same reason that &quot;Imperial Order&quot; WILL negate the effect of &quot;Wave-Motion Cannon&quot; even if chained to the act of sending &quot;Wave-Motion Cannon&quot; from the field to the Graveyard.)

  <p>Individual Card FAQs:</p>
  <p>When &quot;The Eye of Truth&quot; is activated in a chain you do not see your opponent’s hand until &quot;The Eye of Truth&quot; resolves. So if &quot;The Eye of Truth&quot; is step 3 in a 5 step chain, steps 5 and 4 will resolve, then &quot;The Eye of Truth&quot; resolves and your opponent reveals his/her hand, then steps 2 and 1 resolve.</p>
  <p>When &quot;The Eye of Truth&quot; is active and a card such as &quot;Robbin’ Goblin&quot; requires that the opponent discard a card from their hand randomly, the opponent should hide and shuffle his hand, discard a random card, and then reveal their hand again.</p>

  <p>Individual Card FAQs:</p>
  <p>When you declare an attack with this card against a monster of the selected Type, and the opponent activates &quot;Mirror Wall&quot;, the ATK will be halved first at attack declaration, and then increased by 1000 during damage calculation. So the final ATK will be 1500 = (1000/2) + 1000. Similarly, if the opponent activates the effect of &quot;Fairy Box&quot;, the ATK of this card will become 1000, because the 1000 point increase occurs after its ATK is reduced to 0.</p>

  <p>Individual Card FAQs:</p>
  <p>When you use this monster’s second effect, you also get its first effect. So this monster enables you to perform a Special Summon of a Fusion Monster without “Polymerization”, etc., and also acts as a “substitute” for one of the Fusion Material Monsters.</p>
  <p>Using the second effect of this monster does not “properly” Fusion Summon the Fusion Monster. So it cannot be revived from the Graveyard, etc. If you use “Polymerization” then you can revive the Fusion Monster from the Graveyard, even if you used this monster as a “substitute” Fusion Material Monster.</p>
  <p>To use the second effect of this monster, you must Tribute this monster plus the legal Fusion Material Monster (s) written on the Fusion Monster. For example, to Special Summon “St. Joan” you must Tribute “The Light – Hex-Sealed Fusion” as well as either “The Forgiving Maiden” or “Marie the Fallen One”.</p>
  <p>This monster’s second effect cannot be used to Special Summon Fusion Monsters that can only be Summoned by Fusion Summon, such as “Dark Paladin”.</p>

  <p>This card’s effect targets a monster, so you select the target at the activation of the card. You may select a face-down monster, or a monster on the opponent’s side of the field. If you target an opponent’s monster, and then take control of it with &quot;Change of Heart&quot; and attack and do Battle Damage to your opponent, he/she will discard a card. If you target an opponent’s monster, and attack that monster with a weaker monster, causing Battle Damage to yourself, no one will discard a card. The monster targeted by your &quot;The Secret of the Bandit&quot; must deal Battle Damage to the opponent’s Life Points for the effect to activate.</p>
  <p>If the monster targeted by this card attacks directly and deals Battle Damage, this card’s effect will activate and the opponent must discard 1 card.</p>

  <p>Individual Card FAQs:</p>
  <p>When you Special Summon &quot;Theinen the Great Sphinx&quot; you do not have to pay the additional 500 Life Points to increase its ATK, you can choose to leave the ATK at 3500. If you do not pay the extra 500 when it is Summoned, you cannot later decide to pay and increase its ATK, it must be done when it is Special Summoned.</p>
  <p>The effect of Summoning &quot;Theinen the Great Sphinx&quot; is a Trigger Effect, so you may do it during your opponent’s turn if &quot;Andro Sphinx&quot; and &quot;Sphinx Teleia&quot; are destroyed simultaneously.</p>
  <p>Since Summoning &quot;Theinen the Great Sphinx&quot; is a Spell Speed 1 effect (Trigger Effect), you cannot chain multiple Special Summons of &quot;Theinen the Great Sphinx&quot; to one another. This means you can only Special Summon 1 copy of &quot;Theinen the Great Sphinx&quot; when the conditions are correct. You CANNOT pay 1000 Life Points to Special Summon 2 copies of this card.</p>

  <p>A: In a nutshell, you must use &quot;Barrel Behind the Door&quot; in response to an effect that you KNOW will inflict damage to your Life Points (which is why you can&#39;t use it in response to &quot;Dice Jar&quot;). Also, &quot;Time Wizard&quot; causes you to &quot;lose&quot; Life Points.

  <p>You don&#39;t pay Life Points to attack with &quot;Toon Gemini Elf&quot;. If your opponent has a Toon Monster on the field, &quot;Toon Gemini Elf&quot; does not have to attack it. However, it will prevent &quot;Toon Gemini Elf&quot; from being able to attack directly.</p>
  <p>&quot;Toon Gemini Elf&quot; can attack directly, but only while &quot;Toon World&quot; is on your side of the field. (Unlike previous Toon Monsters, which can attack directly even without &quot;Toon World&quot;.)</p>

  <p>Q: If both players have “Toon World” and Toon Monsters on their side of the field and the opponent’s “Toon World” is destroyed, would all Toon Monsters be destroyed or only the opponent’s Toon Monsters?</p>
  <p>A: Both player&#39;s Toon monsters would be destroyed when a &quot;Toon World&quot; is destroyed. Curtis Schultz, 02/01/2004</p>
  <p>Q: If a face-down “Toon World” is destroyed and sent to the Graveyard, are Toon Monsters on the field also destroyed?</p>
  <p>A: All face-up Toon monsters would be destroyed because &quot;Toon World&quot; was destroyed. It does not matter if &quot;Toon World&quot; was face-up or face-down when it was destroyed. Curtis Schultz, 02/22/2004</p>

  <p>You don’t Normal Summon or Flip Summon &quot;Total Defense Shogun&quot; in Defense Position; you Normal Summon or Flip Summon him in face-up Attack Position and he changes to Defense Position. (Or you can Tribute Set him in face-down Defense Position.)</p>
  <p>You cannot chain to &quot;Total Defense Shogun&quot;’s effect that changes him to Defense Position when Normal Summoned or Flip Summoned. So you cannot chain &quot;Spellbinding Circle&quot;, etc.</p>
  <p>Do not change &quot;Total Defense Shogun&quot; automatically to Defense Position if he is Special Summoned, only if he is Normal Summoned or Flip Summoned.</p>
  <p>While &quot;Total Defense Shogun&quot; is in Defense Position, he attacks using his ATK but defends with his DEF if he is attacked. If he attacks a monster with higher ATK, but ATK lower than &quot;Total Defense Shogun&quot;’s DEF, &quot;Total Defense Shogun&quot; is still destroyed because the battle is ATK vs. ATK.</p>
  <p>&quot;Widespread Ruin&quot; and &quot;Mirror Force&quot; cannot destroy &quot;Total Defense Shogun&quot; if he attacks while in Defense Position, and his attack resolves as normal.</p>
  <p>If &quot;Total Defense Shogun&quot; in Defense Position is your only monster, and attacks, your opponent cannot activate &quot;Mirror Force&quot; because it will have no effect.</p>
  <p>If &quot;Total Defense Shogun&quot; attacks while in Attack Position, and is changed to Defense Position by &quot;Windstorm of Etaqua&quot;, his attack resolves as normal because he can attack while in Defense Position.</p>

  <p>&quot;Tower of Babel&quot; must be active and face-up on the field before the Spell Card was activated, and when the Spell Card resolves, in order to get a Spell Counter. If you chain &quot;Tower of Babel&quot; to a Spell Card, you do not get a Spell Counter for that Spell Card. If a Quick-Play Spell Card is chained to the activation of &quot;Tower of Babel&quot;, you do not get a Spell Counter for that Quick-Play Spell Card.</p>
  <p>You can move Spell Counters to &quot;Tower of Babel&quot; with &quot;Pitch Black Power Stone&quot;, but if the 4th Spell Counter is placed on &quot;Tower of Babel&quot; with &quot;Pitch Black Power Stone&quot; or &quot;Apprentice Magician&quot;, &quot;Tower of Babel&quot; is destroyed but no damage is inflicted.</p>
  <p>&quot;Tower of Babel&quot; cannot blow up in the middle of a chain. If you wind up with 5 Spell Counters on &quot;Tower of Babel&quot; after a chain resolves, the player who caused the 4th Spell Counter to be placed takes the damage. So if you have &quot;Tower of Babel&quot; with 3 Spell Counters, and you activate &quot;Pot of Greed&quot;, and your opponent chains &quot;Reload&quot;, &quot;Reload&quot; resolves first and places the 4th Spell Counter, and your opponent takes the 3000 damage after the current chain resolves.</p>
  <p>If &quot;Mystical Space Typhoon&quot; targets &quot;Tower of Babel&quot; with 3 Spell Counters, &quot;Tower of Babel&quot; is destroyed when &quot;Mystical Space Typhoon&quot; resolves, and never gets the 4th Spell Counter, so neither player takes damage.</p>

  <p>Q: If I activate "Trap Dustshoot" when my opponent has 4 or more cards in their hand, but an effect is activated (such as chaining “Book of Moon” or “Mystical Space Typhoon”) after "Trap Dustshoot" is activated that causes them to have less than 4 cards in their hand, do I still get to see my opponent’s hand and return a monster?</p>
  <p>A: Yes. If a player has 4 cards in hand when “Trap Dustshoot” is activated and they chain a card causing them to go below the 4 card requirement you will still get the effect of “Trap Dustshoot.” For the player to successfully dodge “Trap Dustshoot” they would need to use their turn player priority to use “Book of Moon” or “Mystical Space Typhoon” BEFORE you activate “Trap Dustshoot”..</p>

  <p>The opponent cannot activate &quot;Bottomless Trap Hole&quot; when &quot;Twin-Headed Behemoth&quot; is Special Summoned by its own effect, because its ATK is already changed to 1000 at the time of Summoning.</p>

  <p>Netrep Q&amp;As:</p>
  <p>Q: Does “Twin-Headed Behemoth’s” effect only trigger when it is destroyed on the field?</p>
  <p>A: Normally this happens while it is on the field, but if a card effect was to destroy it while it was in your hand or Deck and then send it to the Graveyard, the effect would be satisfied. Say, if I had my opponent&#39;s &quot;Twin-Headed Behemoth&quot; in my hand from the effect of &quot;Exchange.&quot; I Summon it and my opponent activates &quot;Chain Destruction.&quot; &quot;Chain Destruction&quot; could destroy the copy in my Deck and send it to the Graveyard. (&quot;Chain Destruction&quot; includes the text of destroying the affected cards in the player&#39;s hand and/or Deck) This is most likely never going to happen though, so I wouldn&#39;t count on it.

  <p>Individual Card FAQs:</p>
  <p>The ATK of “Tyranno Infinity” changes according to the current number of your Dinosaur removed from play.</p>
  <p>Remember that monsters removed from play go to the “removed zone” of the owner, even if controlled by the opponent, and even if they will return to the opponent’s side of the field later because of “Interdimensional Matter Transporter” or “Dimensionhole”.</p>
  <p>If “Tyranno Infinity” is equipped with “Megamorph” and the number of removed from play Dinosaurs changes, first change the original ATK of “Tyranno Infinity”, and then double or halve for “Megamorph”.</p>

  <h4 id='tyrant-dragona-idtyrant-dragona'>TYRANT DRAGON<a id="TYRANT DRAGON"></a></h4>
  <p>Individual Card FAQs:</p>
  <p>The first sentence of this card’s text means that after you complete an attack with &quot;Tyrant Dragon&quot;, if there is still a monster on the opponent’s side of the field, &quot;Tyrant Dragon&quot; can immediately attack again. You cannot attack with another monster in between, and then attack a second time with &quot;Tyrant Dragon.&quot; If there are no monsters on your opponent’s side of the field after &quot;Tyrant Dragon&quot;’s first attack, &quot;Tyrant Dragon&quot; does not gain a second attack.</p>
  <p>&quot;Tyrant Dragon&quot; cannot attack more than twice, even if there is another monster remaining on your opponent’s side of the field after the second attack.</p>
  <p>&quot;Tyrant Dragon&quot;’s first attack does not have to be the first attack of the Battle Phase. You may attack with another monster, then with &quot;Tyrant Dragon&quot;, then again with &quot;Tyrant Dragon&quot; -- if the opponent still controls a monster.</p>
  <p>Suppose you control &quot;Tyrant Dragon&quot; and another monster (&quot;Dark Magician&quot; for example), and the opponent only has 1 monster. You attack with &quot;Tyrant Dragon&quot; and destroy their 1 monster. Then you declare a direct attack with &quot;Dark Magician&quot; and the opponent activates &quot;Scapegoat&quot; to Special Summon 4 &quot;Sheep Tokens&quot;. A replay occurs, and that means &quot;Tyrant Dragon&quot; was the last monster to attack, so it may attack again, and attack one of the Sheep Tokens. Then you can attack with &quot;Dark Magician&quot;.</p>
  <p>The opponent may activate Trap Cards that target &quot;Tyrant Dragon&quot;, but their effects will be negated and the cards destroyed.</p>
  <p>When you Summon &quot;Tyrant Dragon&quot;, the opponent can activate &quot;Torrential Tribute&quot; or &quot;Bottomless Trap Hole&quot; and destroy &quot;Tyrant Dragon&quot; because neither of these Trap Cards target. (However, &quot;Trap Hole&quot; does target and its effect will disappear if activated.)</p>
  <p>When you attack with &quot;Tyrant Dragon&quot; the opponent can activate &quot;Mirror Force&quot; and all your Attack Position monsters, including &quot;Tyrant Dragon&quot;, will be destroyed. This is because &quot;Mirror Force&quot; does not target.</p>
  <p>You may activate &quot;Last Turn&quot; and select your &quot;Tyrant Dragon&quot; as the monster to keep, because &quot;Last Turn&quot; does not target.</p>
  <p>When you Summon &quot;Tyrant Dragon&quot; the opponent can activate &quot;Solemn Judgment&quot; or &quot;Horn of Heaven&quot; to negate the Summon.</p>
  <p>You can activate &quot;Call of the Haunted&quot; to Special Summon &quot;Tyrant Dragon&quot;. After it resolves, &quot;Call of the Haunted&quot; will be destroyed and &quot;Tyrant Dragon&quot; will remain on the field. You must still Tribute a Dragon-Type monster to perform this Special Summon, in accordance with the text of &quot;Tyrant Dragon&quot;.</p>
  <p>If you activate &quot;Monster Reborn&quot; to Special Summon your opponent’s &quot;Tyrant Dragon&quot; in your opponent’s Graveyard, you must still Tribute a Dragon-Type monster from your side of the field. If you do not control a Dragon-Type monster, you cannot select &quot;Tyrant Dragon&quot; as a target for &quot;Monster Reborn&quot;.</p>
  <p>You Tribute a Dragon-Type monster when the effect that Special Summons &quot;Tyrant Dragon&quot; resolves, not when it activates. So if you activate &quot;Monster Reborn&quot; and target &quot;Tyrant Dragon&quot; and your opponent chains &quot;Imperial Order&quot; and negates &quot;Monster Reborn&quot; you do not Tribute a Dragon-Type monster. Likewise, if you control 1 Dragon-Type monster on the field, and activate &quot;Monster Reborn&quot;, and your opponent chains &quot;Ring of Destruction&quot; to destroy your only Dragon-Type monster, you are unable to Tribute a Dragon-Type monster when &quot;Monster Reborn&quot; resolves and its effect disappears.</p>
  <p>You may Tribute a face-down Dragon-Type monster when you Special Summon &quot;Tyrant Dragon&quot;.</p>
  <p>Even if &quot;Tyrant Dragon&quot; was destroyed by &quot;Dark Balter the Terrible&quot; or some other monster that negated the effect of &quot;Tyrant Dragon&quot;, you must still Tribute a Dragon-Type monster if you Special Summon it because this is a condition, not an effect.</p>

  <p>Netrep Q&amp;As:</p>
  <p>Q: If I declare an attack and my opponent uses the effect of “Ultimate Offering” to tribute the monster I am attacking for a higher level monster, does my attack continue?</p>
  <p>A: A replay would occur because the target of your attack is no longer on the field. Play will return to the Battle Step. You are not forced to attack the new monster. Curtis Schultz, 12/08/2003</p>
  <p>Q: If a player has an active “Ultimate Offering” on the field, can their opponent use the effect?</p>
  <p>A: Only the controller of &quot;Ultimate Offering&quot; can use its effect. Curtis Schultz, 02/13/2004</p>

  <p>Q: Can you use the Spell or Trap cards brought to the field through the effect of “Magical Hats” as a Tribute using Ultimate Offering?</p>
  <p>A: Yes, you can offer the face-down non-monster cards selected from the effect of &quot;Magicial Hats&quot; as Tributes for a Tribute Summon using &quot;Ultimate Offering.&quot; The non-monster cards are being treated as monsters during that Battle Phase, so it will okay to do this.

  <p>Q: If an Effect Monster such as “Sonic Bird” is summoned by the effect of “Ultimate Offering” during the opponent’s Battle Phase, will the effect of the monster still activate?</p>

So if you choose to use its effect and Summon a &quot;Sonic Bird,&quot; the &quot;Sonic Bird&#39;s&quot; effect will after it is successfully Summoned.

  <p>Individual Card FAQs:</p>

  <p>&quot;Waboku&quot; applies to ALL of the monsters on that player&#39;s side of the field for the entire turn.</p>
  <p>To illustrate how &quot;Waboku&quot; works, here are some scenarios and their results:</p>
  <p>SCENARIO 1: Player A&#39;s &quot;Mega Thunderball&quot; attacks Player B&#39;s &quot;Mega Thunderball&quot;, and Player B activates &quot;Waboku&quot;. RESULT: Player A&#39;s (attacking) &quot;Mega Thunderball&quot; is destroyed. Player B&#39;s &quot;Mega Thunderball&quot; (with equal ATK) is NOT destroyed.</p>
  <p>SCENARIO 2: Player A activates &quot;Waboku&quot;. Player A&#39;s &quot;Mega Thunderball&quot; then attacks Player B&#39;s &quot;Mega Thunderball&quot;. RESULT: Player B&#39;s &quot;Mega Thunderball&quot; is destroyed. Player A&#39;s (attacking) &quot;Mega Thunderball&quot; is NOT destroyed. So you can use &quot;Waboku&quot; &quot;offensively&quot; when attacking an equal ATK monster.</p>
  <p>SCENARIO 3: Player A activates &quot;Waboku&quot;. Player A&#39;s &quot;Blue-Eyes White Dragon&quot; then attacks Player B&#39;s &quot;Sanga of the Thunder&quot;. Player B uses &quot;Sanga of the Thunder&quot;&#39;s effect (during the Damage Step). RESULT: Player A&#39;s &quot;Blue-Eyes White Dragon&quot; (ATK 0) is not destroyed, nor does Player A lose any Life Points, because of Player A&#39;s &quot;Waboku&quot;.</p>
  <p>SCENARIO 4: Player A&#39;s &quot;Mega Thunderball&quot; attacks Player B&#39;s &quot;Mega Thunderball&quot;. Player B activates &quot;Fairy Box&quot; or &quot;Mirror Wall&quot;. Player A activates &quot;Waboku&quot;. RESULT: Player A&#39;s &quot;Mega Thunderball&quot; (with reduced ATK) is not destroyed, nor does Player A lose any life points, because of Player A&#39;s &quot;Waboku&quot;. But because Player A&#39;s &quot;Mega Thunderball&quot; had reduced ATK, Player B&#39;s &quot;Mega Thunderball&quot; is not destroyed either.</p>

  <p>Individual Card FAQs:</p>
  <p>Sending &quot;Wave-Motion Cannon&quot; to the Graveyard is a cost, so when you send it to the Graveyard, it&#39;s too late for your opponent to chain &quot;Mystical Space Typhoon&quot;, etc., to destroy &quot;Wave-Motion Cannon&quot;, because &quot;Wave-Motion Cannon&quot; is already in the Graveyard.</p>
  <p>Your opponent cannot chain &quot;Magic Jammer&quot;, or use &quot;Dark Paladin&quot;, etc., when you send &quot;Wave-Motion Cannon&quot; from the field to the Graveyard. Your opponent CAN chain &quot;Magic Jammer&quot; or use &quot;Dark Paladin&quot;, etc., when you first activate &quot;Wave-Motion Cannon&quot; (meaning when you place it face-up on the field).</p>
  <p>If &quot;Imperial Order&quot; is active on the field, count Standby Phases as normal for &quot;Wave-Motion Cannon&quot;.</p>
  <p>You can activate &quot;Wave-Motion Cannon&quot; (place it face-up on the field) and send it to the Graveyard during the same turn, but it will not do any damage.</p>
  <p>If the Standby Phase is skipped with &quot;Solomon&#39;s Lawbook&quot; or the turn is skipped with &quot;Gamble&quot;, increase the count for &quot;Wave-Motion Cannon&quot; anyway.</p>
  <p>You cannot use &quot;Pyro Clock of Destiny&quot; with &quot;Wave-Motion Cannon&quot;.</p>

  <p>If “Imperial Order” is active when “Wave Motion Cannon” sends itself to the Graveyard, the effect of “Wave-Motion Cannon” is negated and no damage is inflicted.</p>
  <p>Netrep Q&amp;As:</p>
  <p>Q: During Main Phase 1, can “Wave-Motion Cannon” be sent to the Graveyard for its effect prior to the opponent attempting to destroy it with a Set “Mystical Space Typhoon”?</p>
  <p>A: As the turn player you could claim priority and send the &quot;Wave Motion Cannon&quot; to the Graveyard, to which the opponent can then respond. This would not be true if you were to activate another card&#39;s effect during your Main Phase 1 first, like &quot;Raigeki&quot; for example, since they could then respond with their &quot;Mystical Space Typhoon&quot; in a chain to &quot;Raigeki&quot; and destroy the &quot;Wave Motion Cannon&quot; in the chain. The opponent would need to destroy your &quot;Wave Motion Cannon&quot; during your Standby Phase. Curtis Schultz, 01/25/2004</p>
  <p>Q: If a “Wave-Motion Cannon” is on my field and I activate “Imperial Order” does it still get its counter during my Standby phase.</p>
  <p>A: “Wave-Motion Cannon” does not use Counters. If “Imperial Order” is on the field, “Wave-Motion Cannon” will still get its phase count, but it does not use physical counters like other spell cards do. bishop, 12/07/2003</p>
  <p>Q: If “Imperial Order” were active after “Wave-Motion Cannon” was activated, when “Imperial Order” leaves play, does the turn count return to 0?</p>

  <p>&quot;Weapon Change&quot;&#39;s effect targets 1 monster. You select the monster when you activate &quot;Weapon Change&quot;&#39;s effect.</p>
  <p>If you use &quot;Weapon Change&quot;&#39;s effect on &quot;Freed the Matchless General&quot;, &quot;Weapon Change&quot; is destroyed.</p>
  <p>Even if the selected monster&#39;s Type is changed by &quot;DNA Surgery&quot;, the monster receives the effect of &quot;Weapon Change&quot;.</p>
  <p>If &quot;Weapon Change&quot; is removed from the field by &quot;Giant Trunade&quot; or &quot;Emergency Provisions&quot;, &quot;Weapon Change&quot;&#39;s effect is not applied.</p>
  <p>If &quot;Imperial Order&quot; is activated after &quot;Weapon Change&quot;, &quot;Weapon Change&quot;&#39;s effect is negated, but if &quot;Imperial Order&quot; is destroyed, then &quot;Weapon Change&quot;&#39;s effect is re-applied.</p>
  <p>If you switch a monster&#39;s ATK/DEF with &quot;Weapon Change&quot;, and then apply a new modifier, apply it to the switched ATK/DEF. Then, after &quot;Weapon Change&quot;&#39;s effect ceases, re-apply the modifier to the reverted ATK/DEF once again.</p>

  <p>If a monster equipped with &quot;Wicked-Breaking Flamberge - Baou&quot; attacks and destroys &quot;Amazoness Fighter&quot; or &quot;Amazoness Swordswoman&quot;, their effects are not negated because they happen during damage calculation, before they are determined to have been destroyed.</p>
  <p>Netrep Q&amp;As:</p>
  <p>Q: Does “Wicked-Breaking Flamberge – Baou” permanently disable monster effects such as “Sinister Serpent?” Or are there some kind of limits as to how long its effect lasts on the monster?</p>
  <p>A: It would work just like the effect of &quot;Dark Ruler Ha Des.&quot; Curtis Schultz, 01/14/2004</p>
  <p>Q: Does &quot;Wicked-Breaking Flamberge - Baou&quot; negate Flip Effects of destroyed monsters, or just “Sangan”, “Mystic Tomato”, and “Dark Necrofear” type cards?</p>
  <p>A: A monster equipped with &quot;Wicked-Breaking Flamberge - Baou&quot; will negate the effect of any monster it destroys. This includes Flip Effect monsters, because Flip Effects are not applied until AFTER damage calculation (at which point a monster has already been determined to either remain on the field or be destroyed from battle).

  <h4 id='winged-kuriboha-idwinged-kuriboha'>WINGED KURIBOH<a id="WINGED KURIBOH"></a></h4>
  <p>Individual Card FAQs:</p>
  <p>If “Winged Kuriboh” is destroyed as a result of battle, its effect will not reduce the Battle Damage its owner takes from that battle, because its effect doesn’t activate until later, when it’s sent to the Graveyard. (And damage calculation has already happened by then.)</p>
  <p>If “Winged Kuriboh” is destroyed and sent to the Graveyard, its effect activates and applies for the rest of the turn, even if “Winged Kuriboh” is removed from play with “Disappear”, or shuffled back into the Deck with “Fiber Jar”.</p>
  <p>Because the effect of “Winged Kuriboh” activates in the Graveyard, it will not be negated by “Skill Drain” but it will be negated by “The End of Anubis”.</p>
  <p>Because the effect of “Winged Kuriboh” activates in the Graveyard, it is the original owner that will get the effect. So if the opponent took control with “Change of Heart” or “Snatch Steal”, if it is destroyed then it goes to the original owner’s Graveyard and they get the effect.</p>
  <p>When “Winged Kuriboh” is destroyed and sent to the Graveyard, the activation of its effect can be chained to.</p>
  <p>After the effect of “Winged Kuriboh” resolves, the application of the effect (making Battle Damage zero) does not start a chain and cannot be chained to.</p>
  <p>If “Winged Kuriboh” is treated as an Equip Card (like if it’s equipped to “Relinquished”) and it’s destroyed and sent to the Graveyard, its effect still activates.</p>
  <p>If your opponent takes control of your “Winged Kuriboh” and when it tries to return to your control you have no open Monster Card Zones, “Winged Kuriboh” is destroyed and sent to the Graveyard, and its effect activates.</p>

  <p>“Winged Kuriboh LV10” has a Multi-Trigger Effect. You cannot activate this effect during the Damage Step.</p>
  <p>The Multi-Trigger Effect of “Winged Kuriboh LV10”can be chained to. You can chain “Barrel Behind the Door” or “My Body as a Shield” to the effect.</p>
  <p>Tributing “Winged Kuriboh LV10” is a cost to activate its effect.</p>
  <p>The “combined original ATK” of the destroyed monsters is calculated after the monsters are destroyed and are no longer on the field. So a destroyed “King of the Skull Servants” would add 0 damage to this effect, and a destroyed “Fusilier Dragon – the Dual Mode Beast” that was Summoned without Tribute would add 2800 damage.</p>
  <p>You cannot activate “Level Up!” to send “Winged Kuriboh LV10” to the Graveyard because it does not have a monster’s name in its text.</p>
  <p>You may return “Winged Kuriboh LV10” from your Graveyard to your Deck with the effect of “The Graveyard in the Fourth Dimension”.</p>
  <p>If an opponent’s monster cannot be destroyed by the effect of “Winged Kuriboh LV10”, no damage is dealt for that monster’s ATK. For example, if “Master Monk” targeted by “Lone Wolf” is on the field, it is unaffected by monster effects, so it will not be destroyed and its 1900 original ATK points will not be inflicted to its controller.</p>
  <p>You can activate the effect of “Winged Kuriboh LV10” if “Skill Drain” is on the field, and its effect will resolve normally and not be negated, because it is no longer a face-up monster on the field.</p>

  <p>If you send &quot;Black Pendant&quot; to the Graveyard with this card’s effect, the effect of &quot;Black Pendant&quot; will activate, because it does not have to be &quot;destroyed&quot;, just sent to the Graveyard.</p>
  <p>You can activate &quot;Premature Burial&quot; to Special Summon &quot;Woodland Sprite&quot; from your Graveyard, and then its effect to send &quot;Premature Burial&quot; to the Graveyard and &quot;Woodland Sprite&quot; will remain on the field.

  <p>If you opponent activates &quot;Snatch Steal&quot; and equips it to your &quot;Woodland Sprite&quot;, they may choose to activate its effect and send &quot;Snatch Steal&quot; to the Graveyard. You will take 500 damage, and then control of &quot;Woodland Sprite&quot; would return to you.</p>

    <li>Q: Does “Zolga’s” Life Point increase effect also apply to Ritual Tribute requirements?<br>
    A: Nope. “Zolga”’s effect only applies to a Tribute Summon or Set. A Ritual Summon, although requiring Tributes, only counts as a Ritual Summon/Special Summon. Steve Okegawa, 01/15/2004</li>

  <p>Individual Card FAQs:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>“Zombyra the Dark” equipped with “Shooting Star Bow - Ceal” may not attack directly.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>Netrep Q&amp;As:</p>
  <ul>
  <li>Q: Will “Zombyra the Dark&#39;s” attack decrease from the modified ATK caused by “Adhesion Trap Hole” (1050), or will it decrease from the original ATK (2100) and then the effect from “Adhesion Trap Hole” take effect each time it destroys a monster. i.e., “Zombyra the Dark” destroys a monster. Is its ATK now 850 or 950?<br>
  A: “Adhesion Trap Hole” will only cause the original ATK of the monster to be halved. So in “Zombyra the Dark&#39;s” case, “Adhesion Trap Hole” will cause it to be at 1050 ATK after being summoned. Then, “Zombyra the Dark&#39;s” effect will cause it to lose 200 ATK points each time it destroys a monster. After destroying 1 monster, “Zombyra the Dark&#39;s” ATK value will be 850.
